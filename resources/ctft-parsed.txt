Positioning + Matchups (Easy to Difficult) 5. Galaxies 6. Contesting Twitch Streamer Gameplay VODs  # 1. Introduction  Hi everyone, I'm[ jlee7x2]  and I  ted playing TFT in Set 3. I peaked at high Grandmaster and also got my smurf ([misterswag]  to GM mostly playing this comp. In my last 25 games (+353 LP), I forced this comp 21 times. 3 of the 4 other times I went Jinx on Dwarf Planet to counter the 7 other players going mech.  I play exclusively on a mobile device while AFK multitasking (exercising, cooking, studying), looking down once in a while for shops/carousel and only sweating during the late game. This is indeed suboptimal and has probably cost me a handful of close games, but the comp is just too consistent so the climb is inevitable. Also playing like this saves mental and increases the volume of high quality performance games. However, I'm probably capped at Grandmaster and to get any further, you might actually have to be a good player.  **Being a mobile player**  * Contrary to popular belief, I find that I actually play much better on mobile than on PC. I don't have very fast APM with a mouse/keyboard to begin with, but moving on a touchscreen is very easy. * Rolling/scouting is difficult, but that's okay since I play the same comp every game and could do the Lvl 8 roll down in my sleep. Positioning can be done very quickly. * I am almost convinced that mobile players have a latency advantage at the opening carousel or maybe it's physically easier to tap a touchscreen fast to click a mouse. I rarely lose that early contest for tear. * By playing mobile, I'm not tied down to a computer and can be semi-productive while playing (LTE connection is great for playing outdoors) - TFT has way too much downtime especially at the  t of the game and between rounds, not to mention overtime. * The only downside is that I really wish that I could type \"me astro no scout no pivot\" in chat at the  t of every game. * Shout out to Yucong for hitting rank 1 playing only mobile only rebels a few patches ago.  **Hardforcing a single comp**  * I hear a lot of comments that hardforcing isn't how the game should be played and that you should play your strongest board and be flexible. At the highest levels, this is probably optimal, but if you don't have the time or the mental capacity to know what's best to play, following this guide is an alternative to gain ELO and obtain that next tier shiny border : ^)  **Hey wait this isn't a Patch 10.17 comp, 10.17 just came out!**  * I expect that Patch 10.17 is a very minor patch when it comes to the meta - 2/4 Sniper buff was nerfed by 1%/2% which should be negligible and Blitzcrank was buffed. This comp has been viable since the  t of Set 3.5 and I think that the small nerfs only make it more likely that you'll be able to go uncontested! The existence of this guide however...  To give credit where credit is due, this guide is adapted from on /u/dennisj9 a.k.a.[ \"The Great Lakes\"' guide for 10.12]  (which I followed to hit Masters in 2 days at the beginning of Set 3.5) but with some added details for 4 snipers, early boards, positioning, and strategies for 10.16.  # 2. The Comp  [Lvl 8 Astro 2 Snipers Mystics w/ Blitzcrank]   [Lvl 8 Astro 4 Snipers]   [Lvl 9 Astro 4 Snipers]   *Note: This general positioning is optimal if you can get away with it. More details about positioning for specific matchups are included in a section below.*  **2 Snipers vs. 4 Snipers**  * Playing 2 Snipers Mystics w/ Blitzcrank is an amazingly consistent build. At ELOs up to mid Masters it is the most free top 4 ever. Blitzcrank is a great early game   and forces opponents into suboptimal positioning and can cheese a backline carry with a well-placed Zephyr. At the very least, Blitzcrank brings in a   to the center for maximum shroom efficiency. Adding Mystics beefs up your front line and allows Teemo 2-3 additional casts which, at least for Stage 4/5, more than makes up for the 8% Sniper buff. Also, Teemo without blue buff needs Karma in order to be any kind of effective. * If I find Lulu at lvl 8 or have Celestial spat, I will pivot to 4 Snipers. Celestial is non-trivial, especially if your Jhin is stacked. 4 Snipers has a higher ceiling and results in more 1st place finishes. However, you should only attempt to go 4 snipers if you are healthy and have hit a lot of your main  s already. Ashe and Cait are nice-to-have sniper/urgot/cc bots but are not consistently dependable, so I find they are more useful in a win-more situation.  **When to play this comp + pivoting**  Always play this comp and never pivot - especially when you get to higher ELOs and see the same people in your lobbies. If you are a madman and willing to hold hands with anyone at any time, hardforcing a single comp is actually advantageous because of experience and early item slams.  **Opening Carousel**  * Tear/Rod    Sword   Vest   Belt     Bow   Cloak. * Try to get a tear first, mainly just to discourage others from going Astro Snipers. * For Mortdog carousels, go for Shroud or Frozen heart.  **Early/Mid Game**  Hold pairs and play what you get. Play your strongest board and try your best to kill  s and not lose. Playing bard for 1-2g is not worth getting aced every round. Your main goal is to make it to Lvl 8 with 30-40 gold to roll around Stage 4 Carousel. If you're losing early, get items from carousel to slam. Always position to try to kill 1-2  s at least. It's okay to lose, but not okay to lose extremely hard.  Rolling before level 8 is an int. There's no   you need early that is worth rolling for. If you roll early and don't hit anything you can just ff. However, if you don't roll and lose streak, you can still easily top4 with proper econ and rolling at Lvl 8.  Frontline options: (Brawlers/Protectors)  Damage options: (Snipers/Blasters/Infils/Demos)  Here are some examples I've found success with  * [Lvl 4 Protector/Pirates]  * [Lvl 5 Brawlers/Rebels/Infils]  * [Lvl 5 Brawlers/Blasters/Pirates]  * [Lvl 6 Cybernetics]  * Bard + frontline (vanguards   protectors   brawlers)    * only play this if you can be winning 60% of the time.  **Leveling/Economy timeline (typical)**  This is obviously different depending on the galaxy, but on average this is a typical rough guideline. Breakpoints can change if you're streaking or playing Bard.  Do not roll until level 8  * Lvl 4 @ 2-1 (sometimes pre-level Lvl 4 at 1-4 if you have the gold and are looking for 2-costs) * Lvl 5 @ 2-3 (pre-level) * aim for 20g at 2-7 * Lvl 6 @ 3-2 (32g/42g)    * This usually costs 12g    * Don't do this if you have nothing to put in. * Lvl 7 @ Stage 3 PvE (40/50g) * Lvl 8 @ 4-2 or 4-4 depending on your health, gold. * Lvl 9 after 2 * Jhin/Teemo/Gnar  Push levels aggressively if you are win streaking to continue your streak and give yourself a chance at your 4-cost  s.  **Stage 4 roll down**  * If you don't have enough gold to level at 4-2 and roll 30-40g, wait until 4-4. Try to have enough HP to sac. It is important that you have gold to roll at lvl 8 because 4-5 of your  s are 4-costs. * **If you have  40hp at 4-2**, level and roll down all the way down and try to stabilize. Also do this if you are contested and the person holding your hand hasn't rolled/hit. * **If you have 40-70 hp at 4-2**, roll to  ~30g each round to find 1 * Jhin/Teemo. Save hp until PvE, roll down at 5-1 to 2 * your  s. * **If you have  70hp**, congrats, sac hp and slow roll. 2 * your carries and go to Lvl 9  **Late Game**  * If you've hit 2 * Jhin/Teemo/Gnar try to go Lvl 9 and put in 4 snipers. Do not roll specifically for any other  s unless you are dying and have the pair already. * If you're playing for top 6 and haven't hit your carry  s, it's a low roll game so just donkey roll, play high risk positioning, and accept your fate. * If you can't make it to Lvl 9 and haven't found Lulu, it's completely okay to stay Lvl 8 and play Mystics + Blitzcrank. Focus on positioning and it's an easy top 4.  **Rolling/Economy Tips**  * If you can 10g at 2-2 or 2-1, do it * Don't pre-level to Lvl 5 if you have 10g at 2-3 * If you have a 3+ lose streak at 2-5, int the last round before PvE * Don't hold  s early if it costs eco unless it's Jhin/Teemo * If you can level and put in something while keeping 30-40g don't be afraid to do it * If you are 5+ streaking and get stronger by leveling while keeping 10-20g do it * Rolling specifically for Lulu at Lvl 8 isn't worth it, just play Soraka and go to Lvl 9.  # 3. Itemization  This comp is so consistent because of its super flexible itemizations and ability to be played from ahead or behind due to its expensive Lvl 8 power spike. There is no single must-have item.  **SLAM EARLY (2-3 components)**  * Blue Buff * Morello   DCap   Spark * IE  If at any time you have 4+ components, make something from below even if it's suboptimal to save hp.  **Items + Substitutions**  * **Jhin** (Infinity Edge, Last Whisperer, Giant Slayer)    * You   Jhin to have 3 offensive items ideally so he can kill a   within the first 3 shots and then another with his 4th shot.    * Last whisperer is overrated and not necessary without IE. Teemo will take care of the Bramble folks.    * Giant Slayer --  Guardian Angel   Deathblade   Bloodthirster    * IE/LW --  DB/Runaans    * Runaan's   RFC * **Teemo** (Blue Buff, Morello, Deathcap)    * If you don't have Blue Buff, you must play Karma.    * Deathcap --  Luden's   Shiv    * Morello --  Deathcap   Guinsoos    * Giantslayer   Hextech Gunblade * **Gnar** (Ionic Spark, Shroud)    * Ionic Spark --  Zephyr   Dragon's Claw    * Shroud --  Bramble Vest   Frozen Heart   GA   Titan's Resolve    * Trap Claw   Zz'Rot   Thief's Gloves * **Wukong** (Thief's Gloves)    * Thief's Gloves   Zephyr * **Lulu/Soraka/Ashe** (Shojin) * **Karma** (Chalice)  # 4. Positioning + Matchups (Easy to Difficult)  **General Positioning**  * I've gotten a lot of flak for clumping and hard cornering my carries together. This isn't typically done and will probably be a controversial point in this guide. The bottom line is, if Teemo/Jhin die, you lose, so you must protect them at all costs. Especially if you don't   to scout every turn, split positioning is too vulnerable to infiltrators. Hard cornering Jhin is the best way to ensure he will get 1-2 4th shots off with maximum Sniper buff. Clumping makes your opponents clump too, and using mystics and Nautilus as a meat shield lets Teemo deal guaranteed massive AoE damage. At the very least you will kill some  s because of focused fire and usually not ever get aced. * If your lobby has 2 or more Blitzcranks, position for it, but leave Nautilus or a mystic in front of your carries to take infiltrator aggro. Otherwise, if there's only 1 Blitzcrank, just take the L if you get matched up with it, or swap sides at the last second. * Position so Gnar on the side that with the enemy carry.  **Left side positioning**  In higher ELO lobbies, your opponents will scout every turn and position for you. However, if you don't have the mental to scout/position every turn, just always swap sides very quickly before the  t of every round. This works maybe 80% of the time if you're fast and frankly that's good enough.  [Left side Lvl 8 Astro 2 Snipers Mystics w/ Blitzcrank]   [Right side Lvl 8 Astro 2 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   [Left side Lvl 8 Astro 2 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   [Left side Lvl 8 Astro 4 Snipers]   [Left side Lvl 8 Astro 4 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   [Right side Lvl 8 Astro 4 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   [Left side Lvl 9 Astro 4 Snipers]   [Left side Lvl 9 Astro 4 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   [Right side Lvl 9 Astro 4 Snipers position for Blitzcrank pull]   **ELO Diff**  The difference between playing this comp in diamond/low Master's and Grandmaster is the late game positioning mind games. You can never move in Diamond and still do fairly well, but high ELO lobbies require focused attention to: Infiltrators, Zephyr, Shroud, where Gnar ults, what Blitz pulls, what Jhin hits, etc.  Hardforcing this comps allows you to really learn the nuances of this comp against other comps which is what can win you games at high elo. I never thought I would match up with some of my favorite streamers and occasionally do well in lobbies with them - I certainly would not be able to do this as a flexible gamer.  **Matchups -** *Easy to Difficult*  **vs. Rebels** (Easy)  * By design Rebels are hard to position and naturally clumped up. Hard position the opposite side that they're on and position Gnar to jump on the Rebel clump. Meat shield around Teemo and it's too free  **vs. Brawler Jinx** (Easy)  * This is the same as Rebels except you have to think a little bit about Gnar, Vi, and Asol. Swap Blitz last second to grab any   not Asol and try to position on the opposite side of Gnar. Many times Vi ult gets stopped by a stray shroom that was used on Zed  **vs. Xayah** (Easy)  * Xayah has a hard time finishing off a Gnar with defensive items and if she gets hit by a single shroom she's basically dead as she's slowed with a very short range. Hard cornering Jhin on the same side as Xayah gives a high chance Jhin will 1 tap Xayah with his 4th shot. Though try to position so Jhin isn't wasting 5 seconds hitting a Shen even though Teemo should take care of a non-3 * Shen quickly.  **vs.   Guardians** (Easy)  * Mystics hard counter this comp as Syndra usually doesn't one shot a 2 * carry. Their frontline dodge Neeko is susceptible getting blown up by shrooms and Teemo/Jhin attacking from across the map is massive amounts of damage  **vs. Cybernetics** (Easy)  * Cybernetics are mostly melee and tend to clump up together making them prime targets for Teemo. Hard cornering your carries together usually lets you kill Ekko before he ults.  **vs. Pirates** (Easy)  * If a perfect item, upgraded GP ults on your there's not much you can do, so pray to fight RNG to have him ult the Gnar that's behind him. Otherwise, it's a pretty easy matchup as Darius has a hard time resetting on a tanky frontline with Mystics before dying.  **vs. Vanguard Mystics** (Easy)  * Vanguards will brawl it out with your frontline while Teemo and Jhin easily clean up. Just make sure their Wukong isn't in a place to cc your backline. Also, make sure to position Gnar in a way that doesn't fling Jayce directly into your carries for a power slam :')   **vs. Astro Snipers : ^)** (Medium)  * Mirror match comes down to whose Gnar smurfs and ults the carry first. It may be advisable not to clump specifically for this case, but I would just swap sides quickly as the greedier positioning has a great advantage.  **vs. Mech Viktor** (Medium)  * This very popular comp is manageable with Mystics. It may seem counterintuitive to hard corner because of Viktor, but staying far away and killing the Mech ASAP (before it ults) is a win condition for this matchup. 2 * Jhin will usually survive a Viktor ult and heals up with Celestial buff.  **vs. Reroll Battlecasts** (Difficult)  * Astro snipers banks on Teemo blowing up squishies and Jhin one-shotting big tanks. This is made much more difficult when the entire enemy team is 3 * tanky. Thankfully, this is not a popular comp and usually dies before late anyways.  **vs. Bang Bros** (Difficult)  * If your opponent has perfect item 3 * Yi, ignore that matchup because you will lose no matter what so better to just position yourself for other people. If it's 2 * Yi, position on the opposite side of the Rebel clump and pray that Jhin 4th shots Yi/Yasuo/Zed  **vs. Dark  s** (Difficult)  * Shaco is very annoying and Xerath 2 outscales your damage and range. It's important for Teemo and Jhin to work together to kill Shaco early so he doesn't smurf your entire team with a full Dark   buff.  **vs. Late game Legendaries (Treebeard/Peeba)** (Difficult)  * This comp usually dies before late game, but if someone is highrolling out of their mind it's okay you can just get 2nd.  # 5. Galaxies  *Easy to Difficult*  **Galactic Armory**   * Lots of early components lets you slam items and streak early because you already know what you're playing. Be careful of being contested though if a tear is included in the common components. In cases like these though, you should have the advantage over your contesting opponents. Slamming Blue/Morello/IE and typing in chat may discourage others.  **Treasure Trove**  * Getting lots of early money lets you build a strong board and econ well. Fully stacking Jhin and Teemo is a key to being successful with this comp so having lots of items is a plus. You can greed and more likely hit optimal items too.  **Superdense**  * Superdense allows you to play Lulu and Karma at 8 which is a huge spike for 4 Snipers. Also, having freedom to fit in random Astros with Bard mid game can help level to 8 quicker as more  s --  longer fights.  **Trade Sector**  * You push levels pretty liberally with this comp which is advantageous for you. Combined with early item slams, it's fairly common to streak early and snowball your advantage to a good finish.  **Normal Galaxy**  * If you get a tear at the  t but not dropped at stage 1, focus on econ and lose early to get a tear at the first carousel. Then stabilize with a blue buff item holder.  **Plunder Planet**  * If you're lowrolling in this galaxy, it's very hard to do well, but the inverse is also true.  **Dwarf Planet**  * Four people hitting Mech stage 3 is nearly impossible to deal with and you'll take too much damage to hit Lvl 8 reliably. So this is the only galaxy where I wouldn't play this comp unless the  s were handed to me. Go any comp that uses Giant Slayer well, hold mech  s, and hope at least 2 people get trolled by fish.  # 6.

Play Blitzcrank with Mystics mostly unless you hit Lulu, then go 4 Snipers for Celestials. Slam items early and don't ever roll until Stage 4 at Lvl 8. Whenever you can get away with it, hard corner Jhin and clump your carries together with other  s as meat shields so they kill things faster and you don't ever get aced.**", "id": "icoqg3", "num_comments": 105, "created_utc": 1597847523}, 
{"title": "Rank 18 Challenger Mech One Trick Guide 10.16", "author": "TtvBananaNationss", "selftext": "   Edit - Saw a Mech guide was just posted but as I already had this written up and spent several hours decided to post anyways. My stream is **twitch.tv/BananaNationss** and I'll be streaming for a bit after posting if you would like to come and ask questions.   Hello, I'm Atornyo and I first hit challenger in NA as a mech one-trick last patch and achieved as high as rank 18 in patch 10.16. I really enjoy mech as I mostly played reroll mech to hit diamond last set and think it is the most interesting composition in the game. I will be referring to mech pilots with a focus on Viktor carry as Viktor Mech.  My lolchess:[    Ideal Viktor Mech Level 8:[   (legendaries can replace  s with similar traits if you find a 2   version of them or find a legendary before 2  ring the   they replace: Lulu Cass gp 1    ziggs if you have an extra defensive item to give gp Ekko shaco)  Level 9:   Items that can be used in Mech Viktor:  For the Mech -   Titan's Resolve - If your mech has one of Hand of Justice or Guardian Angel or both I recommend building this item, without either of these items you won't see much value from Titan's Resolve until you have a level 5 or 6 mech which means you have 2   annie rumble and fizz. This item has the potential to be the single strongest item that your mech can use and is worth playing for every game. The downside to this item is that there is zero value in slamming the item early game as it will never hit 50 stacks until you have a mech online. The only time you are looking to potentially not have this item on your mech is if there are many people contesting (a 4+ mech lobby) the reason for this is because this item greatly increases in value the higher level your mech is. Once it hits 50 stacks your mech will 1v9 especially when coupled with a Hand of Justice or Guardian Angel.   Hand of Justice - This item is so good worth slamming every game as it works well on early game carries and is really solid on mech.  Guardian Angel - Solid item but ONLY place this on your mech if you are certain there will be a Hand of Justice or a Titan's Resolve with it. Works well with Titan's because your mech doesn't lose its Titan's stacks after its first death and can slap around the enemy team after reviving. Works well with Hand of Justice as it can heal a significant amount of HP post mortem. This item also works really well with rumble as he will oftentimes cast after coming out of the mech and his spell doesn't go away while reviving.  Quicksilver - This item is BiS for mech IF you are unable to complete the trifecta mentioned above. In lobbies with many zephyrs this item can result in insane value, however, with optimal scouting you can sacrifice Ziggs and Cass to the Zephyr gods. The reason I believe this item isn't as godly as many others make it out to be is the fact that it does absolutely nothing in a number of matchups other than provide 20% dodge. The problem with this item is that it is NOT slammable until you have a mech online.  Bramble Vest - One of the strongest items to slam early game. If you take an armor off the  ting carousel and are blessed enough to find another by 2-1 you are building this item.   TrapClaw - This item is mostly just a 20% dodge stat boost. This item isn't very slammable early personally, only build if I feel I don't have any other options.   Shroud of Stillness - This item is a 20% dodge stat boost that can turn a fight with optimal positioning. If you build this item you need to scout EVERY round. Relatively slammable early but not on the same tier as bramble.  ZZ'rot - You are building this item because you   to win streak early. Neat thing with this item is that you get two voidlings over the course of the fight.   Warmog's Armor - Probably the single strongest early game item in the game, give a protector this item and go afk until stage 4.   Ionic Spark - Another very slamable item, if you have a rod and a cloak at any point before krugs it is worth slamming as this item will save you infinite HP.   Thieve's Gloves - This item is a bait on mech. In the past I would play Thief's Gloves mech as a transition   while I pivot to a non mech composition. Nowadays I only play mech so don't recommend giving the mech this item. Not a bad shaco item and once you replace shaco with Ekko he loves it.  Itemizing Viktor - Viktor  s a morellonomicon in order to nuke the enemy team's healing potential along with blue buff or Spear of shojin as viktor should be able to kill the backline in 2-3 spells.  If you're considering playing mech here is what you should look to do in each stage:  Stage 1: look to grab Armor Tear Crit Glove on first carousel  s holding these specific items such as armor Malphite/Illaoi or tear Ziggs can be free tickets to winstreaking early. After carousel I try to hold brawlers rebels and infiltrators as I believe it is the strongest opener for mech, however if it is clear that a stronger board is available, such as a 2   poppy or jarvan while you only have 1   Illaoi/Malphite, it is worth pivoting to that. On the round that Kayn appears (1-4) I will prelevel which means I buy experience in order to achieve a level 4 shop on 2-1. This is very important as a   like rumble/shaco/neeko with a belt can win streak the entirety of stage 2. I try to hold on to any Annie I find as I like to hold one whenever possible but it is worth selling her in order to pick up any brawler/rebel/infiltrator or to ensure that you can pre level.  Stage 2: I attempt to win streak through stage 2 every single game, Viktor Mech and Mech infiltrators are not very item dependent and you can switch between the two depending on what items the game gives you. If you have any of Bramble Vest, Hand of Justice, Guardian Angel, Ionic Spark, Warmogs,blue buff, morellonomicon, or ZZ'rot Portal it is best to slam the item as the Mech can hold any of those items other than bluebuff and morellonomicon and those last 2 items are vital for viktor, Illaoi is a great holder for Mech items and Ziggs/ahri are great holders for Viktor items. On 2-1 play whatever your strongest board is as with any non-hyperroll compositions. On 2-3 before the stage 2 carousel I will prelevel in order to get a level 5 shop on 2-5 post carousel, this is extremely strong for Mech Pilot compositions as it gives you the opport y to hit a full Mech on stage 2 or other strong early game  s like rumble gnar wukong and fizz. In the case that you are on a 2 or 3 loss streak after the stage 2 carousel it is best to attempt a full loss streak in order to maximize early gold, this is the ONLY time that I would ever consider attempting to lose a round. If you are running infiltrators in your early game composition it is extra important to scout EVERY round as the difference between an infiltrator hitting a Ziggs or a 2   frontliner is winning or losing a fight.  Stage 3: This is where a lot of decision making enters the game. If I am winstreaking with a streak of 3 or greater and I will have more than 10 gold after leveling I will level on 3-1. otherwise I will level on 3-2. If I have fizz and rumble by 3-2 and am level 6 I am willing to roll down to 10gold in order to hit an annie. If you roll down this early into the game it is vital that you do not tunnel only on  s that go in your final composition, you are not rolling solely to hit a Mech you are rolling to maintain win streak this means that you will look to complete any pairs or to add   upgrades to your current board. If you roll down and do not upgrade your board at all you will be in a very bad place so it is important to keep a very open mind on what can be thrown in to improve your composition. If I don't roll down on 3-2 I usually do not roll at all unless I am taking a large amount of damage every round in which case it can be a good idea to level to 7 post stage 3 carousel (3-5) and roll some gold to stabilize. If you are rolling it is important to not roll below 10 in stage 3 unless you have a great reason to, such as winstreaking and holding 4-6 pairs while knowing there are opponents that can beat you if you don't hit those upgrades.  What to do if you hit early Mech: Mech in stage 3 can be played in many different ways. Most of the time you will sell your frontline and be looking to play Mech + whatever your strongest backliners are which are usually the level 2  s you already had. Ideally you   to have a ziggs and infiltrator or be running 4 sorcs + Mech but it is not vital in stage 3.  Stage 4: This is where the decision between Viktor Mech and Mech infiltrators is made. If you are bleeding out and approaching death  40hp 4-1 it is worth leveling to 7 and rolling down to stabilize. Which means you are playing the level 8 board minus ziggs if by some miracle you hit aurelion sol feel free to play zed/ziggs/asol instead of the mystic  s. However, in the majority of games you will level to 8 on 4-3 and roll for your board.  The 4-3 rolldown (Viktor Mech) - While rolling you are looking to hit this board[   it is discussed earlier when to replace  s with legendaries. Also I value cass and Karma over Soraka as before the mech dies other  s tend to take very little to 0 damage. If you run into a GP Mercenary upgrade in this roll down it is only worth purchasing double strike as they are so expensive. You can stop rolling once you hit the  s in the composition and have a level 6 mech (2   annie rumble and fizz), a 2   legendary or 2   Viktor. If you hit any of those requirements with more than 20 gold and are somewhat healthy you can usually go to level 9 later in the game in order to increase your chances at first place. If you hit a 2   asol and do not have blue buff Asol can replace Viktor at levels 8 and 9.  If you hit it is very likely that you will win streak through stage 4 and into stage 5.  Stage 5: If you rolled down at level 7 on 4-1 you are leveling to 8 and rolling on 5-1 in a last ditch effort to survive. This rolldown is the same as the standard 4-3 one. If you were able to stop rolling early and have hoarded a large amount of gold, look to go level 9. Only go level 9 if you have at least 30 gold to roll or have more than 15 gold and already hold 1 or more legendary pairs. If you are about to die feel free to roll on 8 in order to complete vital 2  s which are any mech pilot   +viktor and shaco. The winconditions for Mech Viktor are good mech items +perfect item 2   Viktor or Level 9 with 2   legendaries. The optimal level 9 composition looks like this[   with the option to replace Viktor with urgot 2 and giving the bluebuff to urgot and the morellos to Asol. While it is situational it is almost always better to run a 2     over a 1   legendary. In the case that you were fortunate enough to find an infiltrator spatula play it on either viktor or gangplank and instead of running Asol play 4 infiltrator level 9:[    If you hit either of these level 9 boards with 2    s it is a 1st unless an opponent has a 3   4 cost   or out positions you really badly.  General advice when playing Mech Viktor:  * It is optimal to run GA QSS if you have titan resolve or Hand of justice but you have to scout every round to ensure your mech doesn't get zephyr'd * It is better to have your mech on either side versus the front * Cass and Ziggs should be placed where zephyrs will land, it doesn't matter if they are frontlined because if your mech gets zephyr'd your chances of winning the round are much lower. * When aiming infiltrators make it so Shaco is jumping straight at a carry, for Ekko you   him jumping on the same side that your mech is to ensure that he casts. * Early game focus on itemizing mech and viktor * Late game focuses on grabbing items for your 2   legendaries. Best in Slot (BiS) for GP - GA, Dcap, Ionic spark (only if mech doesn't have one) Ekko - statikk shiv, rfc, shojin, hoj, runanns. Asol - All damage focused AP items and Hand of Justice. * Always put mech items on rumble as his spell costs the least so he is most likely to cast and get value after the mech has died  Differences between Galaxies  Dwarf Planet - Mech is so busted on this galaxy, I have seen Mech compositions hold hands 1-5 multiple times in challenger elo games. Look for titans resolve as if it procs your Mech will hit the backline. Infiltrators are weaker on this map so keep that in mind when building early game boards. Gangplank is also OMEGABUSTED on this galaxy.  Neekoverse - I just  ed to thank riot for removing this Galaxy  Superdense - I tend to run 4 infiltrator instead of ziggs at level 8. Also if winstreaking you might roll more in stage 3 as any round you win it is likely you're doing an extra 2 damage which puts a lot of pressure on a lobby.  Trade Sector - Greatly dislike this galaxy for Mech but never miss the chance to level if you can afford it while winstreaking. Going level 7 right after stage 3 carousel can be the difference between hitting an early legendary or hitting important mech  s.  Treasure Trove - Not a great galaxy for Mech as you have 4  s in your composition that do not benefit greatly from items (Mystic  s and annie/fizz) Also Mech doesn't benefit too greatly by having perfect items so the benefit that other compositions get is much greater.  Galactic Armory - Great for pushing early winstreaks. Always look to slam 2 full items before any pvp rounds even begin.  Binary   - Look to take glove or tear on the first carousel. NEED to win streak as mech isn't as strong later in the game. Not as bad for mech as people make it seem but you usually need 2 dodge items (QSS, HOJ, Trapclaw, and shroud of stillness) in order to make your mech survive versus the 4 cyber players in the lobby. Need perfect Viktor items as another issue mech has in this galaxy is the fact that mystic  s along with other mech  s can't utilize items well.  Plunder Planet - Always push levels and try to bully other players around. Anytime you can prevent another player from killing any of your  s you are denying them 2-3 gold which is a huge early game. Most of the time you will level to 8 on 4-1 and be 9 in late stage 4 or early stage 5. Can also decide to roll down on 3-5 after stage 5 carousel at level 7 in order to get as much gold as possible off the galaxy and prevent other players from killing  s. Everyone spikes really hard in stage 4 on this galaxy.  Salvage world - I'm still unsure of this galaxy, I have only played 5 games on this galaxy but in 2 of them I opened with a redbuff ludens lucian with blaster buff that felt really strong. Not as important to run an early game composition that can utilize mech items well.  I'm sure I missed some stuff within this guide and will try to answer any questions in the comments over the next few days.", "id": "ib4by4", "num_comments": 77, "created_utc": 1597625890},

You can't corner masteryi if you have zekes/chalice on irelia so that's a big big downside of putting these on irelia.    -items on riven or irelia? Damage items always on irelia, tank items goes on shen, leftover tank items goes on riven, so in general, rarely any items on riven   9. master yi items. Rfc is a must. Rest of flexible. Generally, i prefer runaans- guinsoos- dcap- jeweled- qss- 2nd runaans   jewled is a little sketchy vs mech because they have a lot of bramble vests, which counters jeweled guantlet very hard.   If you're vs 5/6 mech lobby, then rfc + dcap + jg is a good combo to eat the mech  10. If you don't get rfc, what do you do?   PLAY FOR TOP 4. that means SLAM EVERYTHING, and be strong at every point in the game. Roll to 0 at 4-1 if you need to.    Stack the following  s instead    - master with 1 tank item (warmogs/bramble), 1 damage item (dcap), 1 utilty item(qss/runaans).     - zed with bm-  stack with ad dmg    - xayah with statik shiv is usually a free top 4 if you surround her    - irelia-  any item, usually 2-  irelia is a free top 4    - riven is okay to stack, fizz is okay, ekko is okay, aurelion sol,   11. When do you go for 2-  board vs 3-  board. At stage 4, roll excess gold. If you have around 5-6 master yis, then go for 3-  master yi. If you have 6-7 zed/yas/shen, then go for them. Otherwise, fast 8 and fast 9 instead.   12. What do you do when you fast 8/9 and why do you fast 8/9    - go fast 8/9, to finish important synergies    - you need infiltrators if you have items on zed and you   him to carry. Infiltrators is also key to beating mech because your master yi has no way to reach backline unless you position out of your mind     - mana reaver is key to beating gp comps like jinx/mech    - cybers is super important if you have a stacked irelia    - i think celestial is bad, but i know deisik values celestial highly so i might be wrong here    - i think asol is bad in this comp because 6bm ends the fight in around 10 seconds, and aurelion sol needs time to charge up  13. if you're getting contested, just 2-  everything and fast 9  14. positioning, see lolchess portion of my stream vod    - generally, master yi goes in corner because of dodging mech/gp    - if enemies have blitz, master yi goes to the left of corner    - dodging zephyrs, move masteryi left and right    - vs viktor, put masteryi in the middle    - on dwarf planet (but not limited to dwarf planet), put masteryi frontline to snipe their backline and not focus the enemy infiltrators  15. generally fiora   xayah because fiora's stun is really good", "id": "iaym3t", "num_comments": 83, "created_utc": 1597605949}, 
{"title": "Guide to Hyper roll Smorgasbord (prot, crono, sniper, sorce, mystic)", "author": "bigDB", "selftext": "Hi I'm hotbot86 in TFT. I'm no challenger player, but this comp has me climbing fast currently in low diamond. I  ed to share this guide because this comp is so uncontested right now, I thought many could benefit from it. You can see my match history with this comp over the last few days here:              If I'm doing that well at low diamond with a lot to learn, I'm sure others can improve on this. The quick breakdown is: 14 games played with 3 firsts, 2 seconds, 3 thirds, 3 fourths, 2 fifths, 1 sixth for **78% top 4 and 21% first place finish** so far.       **Ideal final comp:**          I found this build scouring the MetaTFT lists for something that could top 4 with low contested rates. I found this:   A **pick rate of 0.04 with an avg placement of 4.37 and winrate of 12.7%**? Sign me up! MetaTFT is not a guide however, so I was left to figure out the intricacies of this build on my own.     **Idea behind this build:** Caitlyn and Jarvan are the core of this build. Everyone becomes tanky combining Jarvan's attack speed boost, celestial, and chrono. You get good CC from Rakan and Zoey, and have potential to have high damage from multiple sources.  **How to play it:**   **Early Game:**  Carousel priority: belt -  vest -  Caitlyn DPS items.     You will almost never be contested for belts, and getting Warmog's and Bramble on Jarvan, and then something on Rakan should be a top priority. When itemizing Caitlyn, scout for efficacy. I think Infinity first is pretty safe, but if lots of vanguards, go Last Whisper next. If mechs or high HP, get Giant Slayer next. Frozen heart is a great Rakan item if you're against lots of infiltrators. Keep him back to slow them. It will give your dps time to do their work and hopefully they will aggro them sooner than later.  Early Game comp examples here:    First you have to be very greedy with your early econ. I don't level at all so I can get to that 50 gold and slow roll at level 5 to get all those 3    s. I prioritize Jarvan, Caitlyn, Twisted Fate, Rakan, Zoey.  *Scout for blitz and infiltrators every round* so you can position your dps in a safe spot.  Try to make sure Jarvan is close enough to give speed buff to your dps.  Getting the early Ashe is ideal, but trying for 2 prot, 2 celestial with Caitlyn, and then looking for chrono with TF is my preferred early comp. I've found it to be more reliable than adding Zoey.  Losing at the beginning/mid game until you get the level 5 comp here:       and  t to get some 3  s will be expected. Don't panic. Stay the course. You'll routinely be beating level 7-8 foes with your own board at 5-6.  I slow roll at 5 until the very last moment and then roll down to 20-30 gold depending on how many 3  s I have. I'll not roll down at 5 trying to hit lvl 3 Rakan as the chance to get him stays the same at lvl 6. From there I'll generally econ and lvl up to 8 (you probably won't hit 9 with this build). I may put more emphasis on leveling if against lots of magic damage comps to get the mystics in there.   **Where this build can have problems:**  * When you are against a lot of magic comps. Try to rush level 8 to get the mystic bonus in. It may even be worth pulling TF and Zoey to get that mystic bonus to survive, but I haven't personally tried this yet. * When you don't scout for infiltrator/Blitz/Zephyr positions. Shroud can also be a bummer, but not as much. Make sure you're protecting Caitlyn at all costs. * When you're against a stacked Gangplank. It's worth putting Rakan and others up front to keep him from blasting Caitlyn and TF down with his ult. * Everyone seems to be going for 2   Jarvan. Your frontline will be squishy, and Caitlyn and TF may not do enough dps to save you. * You get all caster items. Your frontline won't survive, but if you happen to itemize them, you can prioritize TF and Zoey, and they will still do impressive dps. That 4 sec Zoey stun is no joke.  Hope this helps you, but if you contest this build against me I'll be a sad Pengu.", "id": "i94r62", "num_comments": 59, "created_utc": 1597341442}, 
{"title": "All about Jinx! Here's 25 tips on how to play Jinx comps", "author": "TexFalls", "selftext": "Hey I'm TexSummers, [currently Challenger]  and have hit Challenger every set except Set 2 cuz who played that lul.   I'm not that experienced at writing guides. but **what I am good at** is writing down a ton of notes every time I play. So anyways, here's a bunch of the notes I've got related to **Jinx** and comps that can use her well.    I'll also be mentioning two common variations, so whenever I talk about [BrawlerJinx]  I'll  t off the note with \"Brawler\"... and whenever I talk about [DemoJinx]  I'll  t off the note with \"Demo\".  1) Most Jinx cores aim to have the following champs: Jinx - Ezreal - Gnar - Blitz... anything else is **not** 1 % needed (not even good old Malphite).  2) Traditional Jinx comps [can spike at level 6]  but usually don't unless you manage to highroll a Jinx + Gnar before hitting level 7.  3) **Level 7** is one of this comp's biggest spikes since it enables Brawler4, Blaster2 and Rebel3. Your Level 8 comp can include **Fizz** if you're playing Zed as the third Rebel, **Gangplank** if Ziggs, or **Janna** if Asol. Regardless of which variation you're playing, this combination of  s is usually enough for you to stabilize a while.  4) **(DemoJinx)** [This is the strongest Level 7]  you can play with a traditional Jinx comp. Completely unrealistic, since this requires rolling into two 5-costs at level 7 is extremely unlilkely. That's why this comp loves hitting Level 9, so you can roll for all the expensive stuff. Even so, it can survive with rolling at Level 8 and a little bit of luck.  5) You'll eventually have to roll at some point in the game, but **try to hold off until Level 8** to do so, so you have a better chance of hitting key legendary  s. If you're in a situation where you absolutely HAVE to roll at Level 7, you either played the early game poorly or you're  just forcing the comp too hard.  6) Regarding the early game, here are a couple of great openers: [Ziggs with Rebel/Demo/Chrono]  [Ziggs with Rebel/Infiltrator/Demo]  [Kog'Maw with Brawler/Battlecast/Blaster]  [Lucian with Cyber/Blaster/Vanguard]   7) The **Rebel synergy** is chill in the sense that having a 4th or (even 5th) Rebel is never useless, since it still helps buff up your other key Rebel  s. This is why you can play your seven core  s at Level 8 and just add another Rebel in the remaining slot. Holding Malphite is important because you could still just play Brawler4 at Level 9 (although Infiltrator 2 is also possible with Zed - Fizz).  8) **Jinx is extremely similar to Kayle**... Kayle needed 3  s to complete her synergies (+2 BM, +1 Valk), while Jinx needs the same (+2 Rebels, +1 Blaster). Both deal AoE magic damage after fulfilling a certain condition (reaching 70 mana vs getting two kills), both share almost the same core items (GA + RFC on both, while Giant Slayer is BF + Bow instead of Rod + Bow). Both spike at level 7 and make good use of Chrono2... and most importantly, both are very flexible when it comes to building your comp.  9) **Jinx's best items** are Giant Slayer   Rapidfire Cannon   Guardian Angel. GS for damage, RFC for the safety it brings, and GA to protect from burst damage like Viktor, Syndra, or any Infiltrator.  10) Jinx with **Rapidfire Cannon** is really good and IMO underrated. It helps a lot against most matchups because it helps Jinx stay put, increasing her DPS by almost never having to move (much like Kayle when she was around)... but more importantly. it helps tremendously against AstroSnipers (reaching the backline without wasting any time walking up or getting shroomed) and dodge based frontlines, since attacks with RFC can't miss. It also prevents Jinx from walking up to the Mech lol.  11) Asol just needs a **Morellonomicon** to pop off.  12) **Gangplank's best items** are Guardian Angel   Rabadon's   Ionic Spark/Hand of Justice.   13) Whenever you get a **Giant's Belt**, try to find out if it's going to be a Red buff or a Morello, because building both is generally bad.   14) **(DemoJinx)** **Luden's Echo** is an amazing item for Ziggs, who can carry you hard throughout the early game.  15) **Red Buff** is best built on Ezreal, not Jinx... but y'all knew that.  16) If you're playing **DemoJinx**, **Rumble** can hold any GP items + the Morello for Asol. If you're playing **Brawler**, **Ezreal** can still hold the Morello (just remake Ezreal when you hit Asol), while **Zed**, **Kog**, or **Lucian** can hold Jinx items.  17) **Blitz's best items** are Zephyr and Rebel Medal.  18) **(Brawler)** One of if not THE best item on Vi is **Zz'Rot**, since once Vi dies on the enemy backline, the purple dude it spawns is really tanky. The voidling helps create a useful distraction so Jinx has more time to pop off. It can also fuck up Teemo and make him waste 1-2 extra ults on it, saving your team from a ton of damage.  19) **(DemoJinx)** During the earlier stages (i.e. when you still don't have Jinx), if playing with both Luden Ziggs and Blitz, [never EVER position Blitz like this]  since it will waste your Luden's proc, costing you potentially 4 + damage. Instead, position Blitz near the frontline like this so that you bring more potential targets for the Ludens damage.  20) **(Brawler)** While **Janna** is a useful   against VanMyst, it's never a staple. If the opponent is playing Mystic4, converting all your damage to magic damage could probably hurt more than it helps. A good way to know **when to dump Janna** altogether is checking the opponent's bench; if they don't have Poppy and Leona sitting on their bench, then they've more than likely committed to Mystic4.  21) This should be pretty obvious... but **Jinx can't be trusted as the only damage threat** on your team. This is a good reason why I love the DemoJinx build... since Ziggs, Asol, GP, and Jinx are **four** great sources of damage. Brawler builds usually carry only Fizz+Zed or Asol, which sometimes is not enough.  22) **Ekko** is a huge counter to Jinx, which makes playing DemoJinx even better since the spell damage can help out while you wait for the Ekko debuff to wear out.  23) If you're playing well and are at a comfortable spot in the late game (something like Level 8, 50g with +40hp), **Jinx 3 *** is a viable win condition.  24) **Rebel6 Jinx** is fine, but I rarely play it because I don't see the point in playing random Rebel  s like Master Yi and Yasuo when there are stronger  s like Gnar and Blitz. Still, Rebel6 did just recently get buffed so it's still probably worth trying out.  25) If you wanna have some fun, here's a [Jinx Pirates]  build I've been trying out lately.   There's probably a buncha tips that I forgot to add, or some that were too long to even write down. Feel free to agree or disagree with any of these, criticism is always welcome since debating as always a good way to learn new stuff.

{"title": "Viktor   Friends - A guide to laser spam (MASTERS Guide)", "author": "daydreamin511", "selftext": "# Proof with 5+ games played:      # Why this team?  My name is Layzzz on NA server and I'm in low masters. I've lost my interest in this game throughout set 3.5 but I found joy again playing this comp. That's partly because I love three- ring  s and I love mech; this team is fun as fuck to play and it's very easy. It features a 4-cost carry that's not too contested and is very dominant in the mid-game. You don't need to hit a lot of  s to be relevant; just Fizz to complete mech and Viktor to two  s.   # Win conditions  The mindset you should have playing this comp is winning the entire lobby. Thankfully there are plenty paths to achieving this. From my personal experience, a perfect item Viktor and a single three-  mech   can secure a win fairly easily; however, it requires some RNG to hit perfect items. Some galaxy offer this opport y.   1. Perfect viktor items + level 9 Asol 2. Three-  mech (slow rolling level 7) 3. Combination of both   # Core items  * Morello - Viktor *needs* morello against vanguard mystic comps, or generally against any comp that has healing. This item alone will make or break top 4 vs. top 2. Always leave an extra rod open throughout the game in case the game drops a giants belt.  * QSS - This is all the mech really needs in the game because it's the sole front-line in this composition and one zephyr can wipe your entire team out. It also serves as imm y against mech mirror match ups. You need mech in the game to soak damage while Viktor spams laser.  * Blue buff - This is the hardest item to get in this patch because it's contested. You generally   to keep tear open until you can no longer get single item drops.   # Tertiary items  * Titan's Resolve - mid game monster. You'll definitely streak slamming this item on mech in the mid game. Falls off a bit late game but it's crucial in keeping healthy in the mid game. Actual use for bows which is generally pretty useless in this comp.  * Shojin - if the game has blessed you with a third tear, slam this item on Viktor and watch him melt the entire team with spammed lasers.  This is a great item against mirror match ups, assuming you have morello and blue buff. The first one to use laser usually dictate the winner of the fight.  * Ice cream - usually available in late-game carousel when items are maxed out. Slam it on Soraka and buff Viktor.  * Ionic Spark - if you have morello already and have a spare rod around, you can slam Ionic. It's a great mid game item and synergies well in this team.   # Early game                 These are a few examples of the early game compositions I ran. Early game is always a toss up depending on what the game gives you. The best thing about this team is you can slam items without hesitation because the early game  s usually get sold later. The general idea is to slam mech items on an off-tank and viktor items on a   that can utilize it.   Damage item-holder ranking:  1. TF 2. Ziggs (always keep one ziggs for later)  3. Graves (if you go blaster opener route)  4. Ahri   Mech item-holder ranking:  1. Poppy  2. Illaoi  3. Xin   # Mid game      My strategy is to slow-roll at level 6 when I'm 50 and collect pieces. Transitioning to mech is a  *huge * power spike and since mech  s are uncontested in general, you'll eventually get them. If you high roll a Viktor then you're in a good spot. You can either put in Cass or Zed at level 6, it depends what the lobby is like. I will sometimes roll aggressively until a certain amount of gold to find Fizz or Viktor; however, it's very rare I do it.   Sometimes you'll find your pieces early. Don't be afraid to level to 7 while being above 50 and slow roll at level 7. You have a higher chance at finding Viktor2 and Fizz2. If you find yourself stomping out fights while slow rolling level 7 then you're in a good position. In that case, I would just stay at 7 and try to three-  mech pieces.   When do you level 8? This team can hold it's own at level 7 so you can greed and slow roll. However, when it hits the late game and the lobby is stronger / caught up in power level, feel free to level 8 and put in Soraka for mystic.   # Late game     If you haven't found Viktor yet then you should aggressively roll for him, otherwise you can focus on positioning for the most part.   Things that ruin your day:  1. Blitz + zephyr. Position him in the center to avoid getting yanked.  2. Infiltrators. Shaco has died down in popularity but he's the only infiltrator that can one-shot Viktor. Blademaster Zed can also melt him. Clump him or mind game your opponent. 3. Shroud. Just mind game your opponent. Nothing ruins Viktor's day more than delaying his initial cast which is pretty integral in winning most fights.   4. Gnar. You   to spread out a little bit to reduce the chance of getting CC'd into Teemo shrooms. For the most part, it's RNG.   # Miscellaneous   * Level 9 isn't needed. However, I'll go for it in fun, high-econ galaxies like treasure trove, plunder, and re-roll. The win condition is three-  mech so you won't have enough money in most cases to go 9 unless you're incredibly lucky. Asol is the best   to put in to round out the synergy + mana reaver utility and zephyr imm y (good vs. Jynx comps).  * Soraka   Lulu. Soraka is a god. I'll usually stack her third during high item galaxies. That extra heal means = more turns for Viktor to laser. Lulu's CC isn't really important in this team. * Dragon Claw Zed is a nice tech vs. Teemo heavy lobbies. It allows him to stall Teemo.  * Stage 2 can vary. You can pre-level to 5 if you think your board is strong enough. You can econ if your board is weak (higher chance of getting core items). However, one thing you have to do is get to 50 and  t slow rolling. You need to hit 50, preferably at the end of stage 3.

{"title": "Important tips that will help you climb/improve as a player!", "author": "threshhookme", "selftext": "Hello, I am Flashb ng, a semi-casual TFT player that climbed from 0lp master to nearly 6 lp GM in a week with only 50 games played this set. I'd like to share some important tips and even some common mistakes that people in mid-high elo encounter in their lobbies, and hopefully it'll help you become a better TFT player in the long run!  Lolchess:     **1. Two-tricking a comp is one of the most OPTIMAL ways to climb in mid-high+ elo yet also makes you a better player in both the short and long term**  I feel like having a balance between going flexible and forcing a single comp is the best way to improve over the long term. Having two comps at your arsenal allows you to pivot to either comp based on your items (i.e. if you have ad items like bf sword components, go for protector dark   but if you have ap items like rods + a tear off carousel, go for 6-  guardians). Thus, with two-tricking, you can easily avoid the 'I have ap  s but ad items' scenario and vice versa. As well, you can still focus on other components like round-by-round scouting and econ management as you are focusing on building 1 of 2 comps rather than 3-4+ comps.  Note: Below masters, one tricking a comp is the 'fastest' way to climb but the problem with this is that it caps your potential much lower as you also have to learn how to be flexible if you   to climb above master elo. Thus, if you   to enjoy the game and improve with a higher skill-cap potential, I'd suggest two-tricking as described above.  **2. Know when to play for top 2, top 4, or even top 6. This includes rolling at 7 at 4-1 to preserve hp by stabilizing instead of falling for the 'rush 8 at 4-3' common trap.**  In high diamond/low masters, I've still see this scenario too often by other players where they have an unfortunate early game leaving them at 35-55hp at 4-1. Instead of rolling at 7 and trying to get top 5/6, they roll at 8 on 4-3 with only 10-25hp and ending up getting a top8 by dying to a highroller before raptors or early stage 5. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. If you prioritize 'strongest board' post-stage 4, you may get 5th or 6th but that is at least saving you 30lp. Being consistent with steady lp gains is much important for the long term than risking 1st or 8th placements.  **3. Make sure you try to get Shroud of Stillness if possible. This non-negotiable item changes entire fights!!!**  There is no doubt why most streamers (i.e. Kurumx, Rayditz, Soju) have a shroud in one of their frontline  s. A single, well-placed shroud can turn a fight in your favour even if your weaker than the opponent by denying their win condition (i.e. delaying a gnar ult with the possibility of gnar not ulting at all if you kill it fast, delaying a syndra with blue buff from damaging your team, etc.). I've noticed that at least 80% of my games that were top4 had a shroud item, so please try to focus for a vest + glove combo in the mid-late game if you already have carry items.  **4. It is better to contest a comp with opening items that match your intended comp instead of playing an uncontested comp with items not matching your comp. (This applies for non-hyperroll/slowroll comps only)**  I'll give you an example just to illustrate this situation. While you are risking holding hands such as contesting 3 other dark   players, having perfect items for the comp means that you are in a position to knock out the other dark   players. The only difference econ-wise is you rolling at 7 at 4-1 instead of 8 at 4-3 to get the contested  s first, and as a result, getting a good chance for a top 4. Compare this to trying to force an uncontested 6   guardian comp with 3 bf swords and you will guarantee bottom 2 because you are unable to deal backline damage and also waste components on inefficient items in the mid-late game.  **5. Here are some tips regarding itemization on champs and board decisions.**   -  Shojin+(Guinsoo or Hurricane) combo on ashe/janna is BROKEN. Having infinite cc ults with a solid frontline and putting 1-2  s (i.e. protectors) in the 2nd lowest row to protect ashe/janna often nets top 3's.   -  Soraka 2 * without items (entire team heal) is objectively better than lulu 2 * without items in most situations. Replace soraka 2 * with lulu 2 * if the MAJORITY of the lobby has infiltrators.   -  Fizz 2 * is better than ekko 1 * regardless of items, and fizz 2 * is better than ekko 2 * WITHOUT ITEMS. Only replace fizz with ekko if you have ekko 2 * and have a TEAR item (i.e. frozen heart) for faster ult cast.   -  If you are good at positioning/scouting, avoid slamming TRAP CLAW or GUARDIAN ANGEL on backline. If you position your protectors/brawler  s 1 tile above your carry like below, there is almost zero chance that infilitrators will hit the carry first, thus rendering those 2 items above almost useless. If you make either trap claw or guardian angel, I'd recommend putting it on the frontline where TC is guaranteed to cast and you can guarantee a stabilizing frontline ult (i.e. gnar, neeko, jarvan). For this patch, GA on shaco is also considered meta as its still a broken infiltrator  .  Example of anti-infiltrator positioning for 4 DS:     -  DO NOT BUILD MORELLO ON JANNA. She will NOT do burn damage with her tornado yet I still see a couple low master/high diamond players do it to realize that they wasted an item on her.

I've generally been a meta adhering, flexible player, but last patch I opted out and spammed protector infiltrator, and this patch I've found something much better. I've climbed over 8  LP combined across 3 accounts to  almost Challenger this patch playing this comp almost exclusively, so I figured it was time to make a guide. Lolchess: lolchess.gg/profile/oce/qosk / lolchess.gg/profile/oce/Thoppie / lolchess.gg/oce/profile/manpede  **WHAT'S THE COMP?** : I  ted playing this comp when I realised that the old Caitlyn reroll comp benefits more from rushing 9 than from 3  s. Basically, it's Ashe carry into Xerath/Janna, and abuses a really strong and cheap midgame board to push level and scale with OP stuff. Midgame:   (Rakan can be Xin Zhao) Lategame:    **STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES** : It's really good on Trade Sector, Treasure Trove, and Dwarf Planet. The rhythm of the comp means loss streaking for eco is preferable to playing strongest board always, so it's generally a comp you   to force from round 1 rather than roll into. You lose to Astro Snipers but win vs most other meta comps like 6 Dark  s and 6   Guardians.  **WHY SHOULD I PLAY IT?** : It's got a million carries, pretty hard to 8th with, and you stabilise with 1   Legendaries. Watching Ashe stunlock the entire enemy frontline while Xerath annihilates them is pretty cool too.  -------  **HOW TO PLAY IT** :   FIRST CAROUSEL PRIORITY : Belt   Chain/Tear   Glove/Sword   Cloak/Rod   Bow ITEM SLAM PRIORITY : Warmogs     Bramble   Shojin/Spark   IE/Deathcap/Runaans/whatever normal good items  Hold all of your core  s (Jarvan, Zoe, Rakan, Cait, Twisted Fate, Ashe). If you roll a million Zoes or Jarvans they are good  s to 3   but the others not so much. Eco HARD and NEVER level before Krugs; I generally try to have 10 gold by 2-2, and 30-40 by krugs. I full loss streak into Krugs maybe 50% of my games, but if that's going to put you below 70 at Krugs, it's ok to win some rounds (or winstreak if highrolling). Ashe 1 with Shojin is often a winstreak into krugs, or Jarvan 2 with Bramble/Warmogs/Spark.  After Krugs is where things get a bit weird. You can roll to 40 at 4 if you have a zillion pairs, otherwise slowroll at 5 until you hit Jarvan 2  and most of your board 2  red. _YOU WILL VERY RARELY TOP 4 WITHOUT JARVAN 2 EARLY SO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVEN IF IT FEELS TERRIBLE_. Once you have Jarvan and hopefully an Ashe, you can  t spamming levels. position in a pyramid midgame like the lolchess builder link to maximise Jarvan value and help Ashe peel vs infils. Shojin  ts being really important to look for around here.  Level to 7 on 4-1 and add anything, I usually add Jhin, Karma, or another Zoe/Jarvan 2 if I'm trying to 3   them. If you hit them you can put Gnar Teemo and Bard over Cait TF and Zoe. If you're getting DESTROYED you can roll down here for Ashe 2 but if you're just a bit low it's better to wait and roll at 8. Go 8 as soon as you can do so with at least 30 gold to roll, usually 4-3 or 4-4. I usually add Mystic or 4 Sniper. If you're really healthy or strong, don't roll. Normally roll to 10, hopefully hitting a legendary (usually you won't on first rolldown). If you hit Janna you should fit her no matter what. Donkey roll until stable if you're weak.  At 5-1, Jarvan has fallen off, and Ashe is your hard carry now until you hit 2   legendaries. QSS is one of your strongest items now so prioritise it from here onwards (slamming it earlier is usually a grief as it is bad early game). Rushing 9 is really important for this comp even if you lose hp, so if you can go 9 with 40+ gold and 30+ hp do it. Roll at 9 for your guys. Xerath can take any random items, but QSS and Deathcap are ideal. Rageblade is just OK but he usually almost caps his attack speed anyway. Trap claw Janna is amazing.   Positioning with this comp is incredibly awkward. The most important things are cornering Janna, keeping Karma and Jarvan near Xerath, and dodging Shroud. but other than that it's incredibly situational and requires some experience with the comp. Usually lategame you need to spread a bit to not get owned by AOE like Teemo, try to use Rakan to manipulate targeting like Gnar and GP away from your carries. Good luck.  Notes: Jhin with just one offensive (IE/Runaans) can also carry in this comp. Deathblade Ashe is sleeper good if you get way too many swords. 4 Celestial with Lulu over Soraka is better if you have Celestial spat or FoN. It's called the Elliott comp because that's my name and realistically it's going to get called something else anyway.", "id": "hsm0py", "num_comments": 45, "created_utc": 1594946560},

You either pick snipers with jhin carry or sorcs with xerath/syndra carry.

{"title": "Guide to 6 Battlecast - Breaking out of the Big 3", "author": "EverythingOP", "selftext": "Hi all,  It's no secret that the meta is rather stale with most people going for Vayne, Jinx, and Riven comps. In almost every game I play, I don't have a lot of success playing meta and usually prefer to find weird anti-meta/off-meta picks. I got really tired of playing one of the big three so  ted playing Mech to limited success. Then I  ted 6 Battlecast and climbed from ~70 LP Masters to now 320 LP (though I played other comps too in this climb). Here are my Battlecast stats below from about 11 games played.     This is my first guide written so let me know if there is anything I can improve on.  **Why play 6 Battlecast**  I think its a decently strong comp for climbing purposes only. As you can see, I have a really high top rate but really low win rate with this comp. To be honest, it is a bit player diff since this set I have had a low win rate in general. I think the comp is rather fun to play to see all of the battlecast procs, and is also easy due to how straightforward 6 trait comps are in general.  **Pros**  * Strong for climbing. This is because of people usually contesting one of the Big 3. Battlecast spikes early at level 6 and you will winstreak hard and do big damage to low rollers. In non high elo (GM+) lobbies, there is usually a skill gap in lobbies and people will not know how to play from behind, allowing you to at least top 6 almost any lobby through developing a large health and gold lead.  * Generally uncontested. It is very easy to upgrade the  s you need. Kogmaw can be contested early from Jinx players, but otherwise, Illaoi, Nocturne, Cass, are all uncontested and can be upgraded easily.  * Strong matchups into Big 3 before their endgame. Nocturne jumping and getting fear on Vayne/Jinx is really good. Urgot eating Riven can quickly turn fights in late game against sorcs.  **Cons**  * Really bad scaling. Once you do go to end game, you will probably go on a large lose streak. The purpose of this game is to win through attrition; from the large health lead you've gained through winstreaking in the mid-game, hopefully you will top 4 from everyone's end game comp beating up on each other.   * Reliance on a legendary  /spat. 6 battlecast is absolutely necessary to survive the terrible endgame. If you can't hit, you will suffer large losses and lose your win condition of barely scraping into the top 4.  * Weak in stronger lobbies. I end up occasionally in GM/Chally lobbies but I cannot conclude the strength of this comp in these lobbies. I believe that it is weaker in general due to the lobby being closer in strength making it difficult to generate a high health lead (even if you win they will probably get good losses) and people knowing how to play better from behind.  **Early Game**  The general indicators to play 6 battlecast are early upgrades to Illaoi, Nocturne, and components for Kogmaw. Kogmaw absolute core item is Red Buff and needs one of Shiv or Runaan's Hurricane. I prio Bow on first carousel because it can be either RH or Shiv, but I've seen ideas of Vest prio for Red Buff. If you get good items, but no upgrades, it may be worth it to lose streak early for carousel priority, and to stay lower level to complete Illaoi and Nocturne upgrades. Here are some early game boards.  [Early Kog]   [Infil Open]   In Early Kog opener, Lucian is replaceable to hold Kog items, or if early Ezreal then Graves can hold Kog items. Blitz can replace Malphite. Play what makes sense in the context of your game.  **Mid Game**  The biggest spike is at level 6 and getting 4 battlecast, 2 chrono, 2 blaster with one core item on Kogmaw. Until you get there, just play whatever you have that is strongest. Again, the purpose of this comp is to win streak. As soon as I can put in 4 battlecast, I level to 6. I avoid aggressively leveling to 7 as I like to stay at 6 for increased chances of upgrading Kogmaw. Stage 4-1 is always a level 7 and then roll an appropriate amount of gold to maintain econ while upgrading your board. Since this board is pretty self-explanatory, look to snipe carries with Blitz/Noc to cheese out wins. If you can't hit these  s, or have bad items at this stage, look to pivot out. I pivot to Bang Bros (shares Runaans as core item), Jinx (if high roll early Jinx), or even once Mech (had really bad items). In the mid-game, you should also look to  t building Urgot items (GA and mana items) as well has hopefully completing an Ionic Spark for Illaoi. GA is really good on Urgot to trade 1 for 1 in the endgame (saving health) as well as stalling for tie breakers.  [Mid-game Board]   **End-game**  Ideally, by the time it is time to level to 8 (between stage 4-3 to 5-1), you'll have generated a 50 health lead over the 7th and 8th place people. Now, the goal is to complete the trait with Viktor and Urgot to try and survive to 9. Until you hit these  s, splashing traits like Mystic (Karma/Soraka/Lulu) or Infil (Fizz/Ekko) or front line (Gnar) are great to help you survive and can hold Urgot items. Similar to mid-game, you are looking to cheese out wins with Blitz/Infil/Urgot. Urgot targets the furthest   in his range which is 3 hexes. Once you have hit 6 Battlecast, look to go 9 to add in Mystic/Asol/Ekko/any other broken  . Battlecast matches up really bad against Sorcs so Mystic is usually my go to since it helps against Mech and Jinx.  [End-game Board]   **Other Notes**  * Urgot targeting is getting changed to the farthest   but can be blocked. This makes it difficult to snipe back row carries. He also doesn't eat through GA anymore making it difficult to fight Riven Sorcs.  * Requires flexible gaming. If you don't hit early and spike too late, you will die very quickly. Think about how the items you make can be flexed into other comps. I flex RH into Bang Bros for Yi and Spark flexes into every comp. When you play 6 Battlecast, try to have an out in mind if you can't make Red Buff, can't hit Kog, or are contested by someone high-rolling Battlecast  s.  * Extra AP items go on Cass/Viktor. I put them on I feel is stronger at the time. Viktor 1 is also stronger than Noc 1, but I prefer Noc 2 over Viktor 1 as my 4th battlecast in the mid-game. Use whatever is appropriate (Viktor can be strong against Sorc backlines and Jinx clumps, Noc strong against solo back line Vayne).  * Who does Spat go on. I haven't really had a large enough sample to tell. I really like Asol not because it is strong but because Asol is just broken. He helps you beat Sorc comps. I've seen people say Gnar which is good as added front line in a very weak front line comp, but you end up stuck with 3/4 brawler since you may need Mystic/Asol in at 9. If you hit Gnar 2 though then obviously it is better. Spat Item generally is an Urgot replacement, then Urgot replaces Nocturne.  * Galaxies. Battlecast is super strong in Littler and Binary  . It is good in Treasure Trove (access to Spat, easy to high roll items), Reroll (can high roll upgrades early, potential 3   though I don't usually go for Kog 3), and   Cluster (same as reroll).  I haven't played that many games with Battlecast, but the results have been very positive so far. Hopefully, this will increase the flavor of your games in the last few days of this flavorless meta. Let me know if there's anything I can improve in my guide; I realize I don't go over general Econ strategies or flex options. I think there's lots of good information in high-elo streamers on economy vs aggressive leveling. I find my playstyle to try and balance both but leaning more towards econ is king.

{"title": "3.14 AstroSnipers Guide - An Underrated Top 4 Comp", "author": "daydreamin511", "selftext": "# Why use this?  My favorite way to climb is using carries that are still viable and deviate from the metagame. Popular four costs in this meta is Jynx, Riven and Viktor. Teemo and Jhin barely make an appearance in Masters elo. This team construction is *nothing groundbreaking* but it does have a different approach in terms of item priority in this metagame.  # Mentality to have in the early game  Chase defensive items against this heavy damage metagame. The priority is to chase bramble / dragon claw on your front line because this will serve to win you fights against popular compositions in the late game while maintaining a strong momentum in the early / mid game.  Defensive items are king in the early / mid game - you will either win or lose by a tiny margin with the main goal of preserving HP. This team comp is quite expensive so preserving HP and econ is important during the roll down.  In the late game, fully-itemized Wukong serve to \"hold down the fort\" against popular compositions because this team is reliant on having a strong front line so they don't get to Teemo who is a vital part of this team. Fully-itemized Wukong can stall Jynx, mech, Riven, and cybers.  # What's the ideal early composition?  You can get creative with the compositions but ideally you would   to collect 2 vanguard or 2 brawler as your front line - whichever one is closest to two  s. Leona, Poppy, Illaoi, and Malphite are perfectly fine as Bramble / Dragon Claw placeholders.  # How to fight against popular compositions?  ***SorcRiven***        Against an S-tier comp, this variant can hold it's own against it. It really depends but the usual flow of the fight with this version is Viktor laser.  Second version also works if you high roll Urgot and Thresh. Pocket Urgot can deal with last-(wo)man standing Riven which is usually how the flow of the fight goes.  ***4 Brawler Jynx***     Aimed to pull Jynx and brawlers forward and get 's funneled in the middle where Teemo drops a bunch of shrooms. Jynx without RFC will walk forward and waste her time with shrooms slow. This positioning has won me a bunch of fights against this team. Fizz-variants can't isolate Teemo because it will land in front of the tanks while simultaneously drawing in brawlers. Soraka's heal comes clutch in this situation because she gets hit by Fizz ult. Without Morello's, Gnar can ult and displace  s and buy time for Teemo to drop shrooms.  ***Cybers***  One of the easier match ups because of the focus on defensive items. A strong front line is good against Cybers and a majority of the carries are melee so they're pretty much rendered useless against Teemo shroom spam. Although there are two variants I like to use depending on the team.     Talon Irelia = use brawler jynx variant to protect her from being assassinated. Same results = funnel the melees in the center into shroom field.     vs Non-talon Irelia  I'm a big fan of Thresh over Blitz if i high roll it. Great pocket picks: graves, lulu, urgot, another CC tank. The more bodies on the field, the better because they serve to stall for Teemo. Keeping Teemo alive is extremely important.  # Conclusion  That's pretty much it. It's really nothing new but prioritizing defensive items in this meta has made this composition a pretty solid team to force especially when Teemo is nearly uncontested. Compared to the previous patch with the focus on prioritizing Teemo items, this version has made it quite viable. It has a fluid early / mid game as long as you have a strong front line to place-hold bramble and dragon claw. It fares well against popular compositions and you have a chance to three-  Teemo which is basically an auto-win with great positioning.", "id": "hi7bsl", "num_comments": 25, "created_utc": 1593460488}, 
{"title": "[10.13] The Great Lakes 1-Trick Jinx-Brawler Challenger Guide", "author": "dennisj9", "selftext": "Hi All,  It's [The Great Lakes]  your favorite 1-tricking Challenger assistant principal. Each patch I pick a comp to 1-trick to Challenger, playing only that comp until I hit Challenger. For Patch 10.13, I chose to 1-trick Jinx-Brawlers to Challenger.    ;  **Past Challenger 1-Tricks:**  * [  Guardians]   * [Mana Printer]   * [Void]   * [Astro Snipers]     ;  **Intro**   While there have been dozens of Jinx guides published over the past few months, my approach to the comp differs a bit from my other Challenger peers in a few key areas. Jinx is the most contested champ in the game right now. However, because of my rolling and leveling patterns, I am able to obtain between 6 and 9 Jinx on a relatively consistent basis. My positioning also mimics my previous Void Brawler positioning which I've found a lot of success with yet again.    ;  **Let's get into it.**    ;  #1. Stages of the Game:  **[Strongest Level 6]    **[Level 7]    **[Level 8  (No Asol )]    **[Level 8  (With Asol )]    **[Level 8  (Double Jinx )]    **Level 9** (Toss another Asol in somewhere. Why not.)    ;  #2. Positioning and Rationale:  **Pyramid Formation Rationale:**  As mentioned in the intro, I decided to mimic the pyramid formation I used during my time as a Void 1-trick. After getting absolutely slayed by infiltrators and Sorc Rivens for most of patch 10.12, I decided to implement a formation that deals with the current meta well.  To reiterate, I am no expert at positioning. I am actually very mediocre at this aspect of the game and I'm typically outclassed in most of my lobbies when it comes to positioning. With that being said, I depend very heavily on my default positioning to take care of most matchups. Because of this approach, I am able to compete at levels far above my actual skill level.    ;  **The Pyramid Formation Gives Three District Advantages:**  * It protects Jinx from infiltrators positioned in any way. (I'll go into a little more detail about this) * Blitz acts as a sacrificial pawn who keeps Mechs and Rivens away from my backline while still activating his ult without fail every fight. **He should be moved up to the front row if you are ever about to go up against a Riven-Sorc or Mech player.**  * There are very few champions that need to be moved in a round. At most, I move two or three champs over 1 or two spaces each round.    ;  **Asol:**  Why isn't Asol positioned in the back? He is immune to Blitz hooks and is more protected in the back corner. These points are absolutely correct. However, your boy Asol also has a bad habit of bailing on Jinx. Against infiltrator players, Asol simply walks away from your Jinx and often deaggros from the infiltrators, leaving your girl Jinx alone with Ekko and whatever other monstrosity your opponent gave an infil spat to.  You know who doesn't bail on Jinx? Your trusty Malphite. Good ole beefy Malphite. He'll stay by Jinx's side until he dies, providing both protection and moral support to Jinx as she takes care of business. Yes, Asol becomes more exposed moved up a row, but he is there for utility. Jinx is there to carry. Position to take care of Jinx.    ;  **Blitz:**  Poor Blitz. Blitz is here to serve three roles as your most forward  :  * Keep scary frontline  s away from Jinx. Remember to move him up if against Riven or Mech. * Take initial aggro from enemy  s so Gnar has a chance to ult before being bursted down * Pulling a squishy   to close to Jinx to help her reset faster. Blitz is guaranteed to get his ult off, which makes him an expendable  . I tried a few combinations in the frontline, but Gnar kept dying sooner than I  ed him to. This formation gave me the best results in terms of utilizing champions and survivability.    ;  #3. Leveling and Rolling.  This comp requires you to spend gold aggressively in the mid game in order to sustain yourself  and acquire Jinx on a consitent basis.    ;  **Level 4**  I always try to level to 4 on 2-1 if I can. Hitting a Vi or Ezreal early creates a smoother early game transition and allows for you to spend less gold on temporary  s while sacrificing little to no power.    ;  **Level 5**  After the round 2 carousel, I will level to 5. If i can't make econ, I'll pre level for an earlier chance at 4-costs.    ;  **Krugs**  Try to have 20 gold by Krugs. Which is crazy to say because I'm used to having 40 gold at Krugs, but it's a different world out there these days fellas.    ;  **Level 6**  I level to 6 on 3-2 like every other chump. Econ from here on out.    ;  **Level 7/Wolves**  Time to make it rain, boys. On 4-1, level to 7 and roll down to 20 gold. Your comp hits full strength at level 7, so 2- ring  s and finding Jinx will allow you to win streak throughout stage 4. This is the stage where many players take large amounts of damage and  t trending for an early exit. Since adopting this strategy, I have yet to have a non-top 4 finish. Take note that I am sacrificing the potential of level 9 and 1st place finishes for consistent success with this strategy.    ;  **Level 8/Raptors**  Level to 8 and roll the rest of your gold. Pray for the Asol and pop those bad boys in as you get them. Save Fizzes as you roll as he will chill with you until you hit Asol or a 2nd 2-  Jinx. Donkey roll if you are low health or save gold if you are healthy.    ;  #4. Carousel Priority and Jinx Items: My default is always to go for gloves first on the opening carousel as you need two of them and IE/LW is an amazing 2-item combo. Most people splash in vanguards in their early game too. However, if you can't get gloves,  BF sword is a great alternative. If you can't get these two items, try for Bow or Chainvest. Try to stay away from picking tears or rods. You can absolutely use these items on Ezreal or Asol if you get them. You can even make Spark and Frozen Heart with them, but they add a bit less power to your comp than the other items.  My default is to build Infinity Edge and Last Whisper, but If I don't get gloves or notice there are few to no vaguards in the lobby, RFC and Deathblade are great alternative items. I would warn against building a Giant Slayer before wolves as very few  s are going to have the health threshold to make the item worth it.  If you get two BF swords to  t the game, go ahead and slam the death blade for early game power and an overall useful item on any blaster who is holding items for you. If you have red buff components, I highly recommend building that as soon as possible too.    ;  #5. Item holders: The dream is to obtain Illaoi as your Gnar item hold and Kog as your Jinx item holder. These two  s will absolutely carry you through the early and mid game. If you can't find Kogmaw, a Cybers  t  with Lucian as the item holder is also a strong item. If I have to, I'll run a Zed/Nocturne backline with Nocturne holding Jinx items until I get two blasters to replace him with.    ;  I'll be around to answer questions if you have them.  **-The Great Lakes**", "id": "hgyg1v", "num_comments": 131, "created_utc": 1593281660},

For point 1, avoid putting ahri frontline, and usually avoid putting her second line as she's vulnerable to  s like Jayce/Teemo/Rumble/Super Mech. For point 4, usually avoid her putting her 4th line as she's too far and her orb doesn't hit enemy backline  s.       With that out of the way, it's points 2 3 that no one fully understands.   First, let's address how Ahri's ability works. She will always cast her ult at the target she is attacking. Her ult will always travel a length of 5 hexes away from her. Her ult hitbox is exactly the width of 1 hex.   Here's an example. Her ult will hit those 5 hexes exactly because the width of her ult     However, if ahri's ult hits at a slant, she will hit about twice as many hexes. I've marked the hexes she hits. Didn't mark the furthest hex because I'm not 1 % sure she hits that hex (she probably does)     Knowing this, one of the key insight is to avoid placing ahri such that the first target she'll hit is on a direct diagonal.       Second, let's talk about how enemies wrap.       Given the following positioning. The enemy malphite will wrap around the outermost poppy. There are several scenarios (i'm not going to cover them all), but most of them can be manipulated so that ahri hits many enemy frontlines.      Below is a very common scenario. Ahri targets the right side malphite, and two malphites wrap around poppy. In this case, ahri's ult will hit 3 enemy frontliners.      Here's another scenario. Ahri targets the right side malphite, one malphite wraps poppy and one wraps around ahri. Ahri's ult will hit 2 enemey malphites.      Here's another scenario. Ahri's targets the left side malphite, both malphites wrap around poppy. Ahri's ult hits 2 enemy malphites.          Because of these 2 points. You should almost always place Ahri exactly 2 spaces behind your outermost frontliner due to how wrapping wroks.   Here's 2 very generic positioning I default to. Both positioning allows enemies to wrap round your poppy and ahri's ult to always hit multiple  s.         Finally, there's a very common noob trap I see everyone make, putting her in the velkoz spot. The reasoning is that against bad players, ahri's ult will be able to hit multiple backline  s. Below is an example.     However, a good player can counter the positioning very easily by moving their malphite one over.     To summarize, this is meant to be a  ting point for ahri's positioning. Once you understand these basic principles, you will be able to extend them and  t positioning based on more complex factors. There's endless possibilities that you can do to make sure Ahri's ult hits more  s every fight.       TLDR; Use the following 2 generic positioning if you don't   to read this guide. You'll see a huge improvement right away.    ", "id": "hfd48a", "num_comments": 109, "created_utc": 1593047216}, 
{"title": "[10.12] The Great Lakes 1-Trick Teemo Carry Guide", "author": "dennisj9", "selftext": "Hi All,  It's [The Great Lakes]  your favorite 1-tricking Challenger assistant principal. Each patch I pick a comp to 1-trick to Challenger. It took awhile to work the kinks out, but for patch 10.12, I created a Teemo Carry comp which I 1-tricked to top 1  NA.  This guide will be a little different than the others for two reasons: One, Challenger has not been released yet, but at the time of writing this guide I hit top 1  NA, which warrants a guide I suppose. Two, I   to go into a little detail on how to successfully 1-trick.    ;  **Let's take a look at the comp first**    ;   #The Great Lakes Teemo Carry    ;  #1. Stages of the Game:   **[Preferred Level 6]   I rarely achieve this comp or even a variation of this comp at level 6. Please see disclaimer.   **[Level 7 Comp]     **[Level 8 Comp]   **[Level 9 Comp]     ;  **DISCLAIMER***  Levels 4-6 are WILD right now. People are pushing levels super early. There are more champs in the pool, so you can't reliably hit a preferred early game comp. 4-costs are showing up on boards before krugs. You boys need to be flexible gamers at this stage in the game and play your strongest board while trying to econ for fast level pushes. I know  JUST PLAY YOUR STRONGEST BOARD AND ECON  isn't stellar advice by any means, but it's the state of the game in the early levels right now. This is healthy for the game overall, but it means I can't deliver unto you a consistent early game strategy as rerolling and utilizing low cost champs in the late game are a thing of the past. Battlecast/brawlers/blaster is also a great opener, but it really just depends on what you hit early.    ;  #2. Positioning and Champion Rationale:    **Why Not 4-Snipers?**  First off, I feel very comfortable with builds that you can complete at level 8 instead of level 9. 4 Snipers is a comp that comes fully online at level 9. While many players who are better than me can consistently hit level 9 every game, I acknowledge the weaknesses in my play style and work around them to compete at the highest level. My econ game is not stellar, so I only hit level 9 every other game or so and only with the help of an early game Bard. This build hits full stride at level 8 and is perfect for players who do not have a full mastery of the game such as myself.    ;  **Why Blitz?**  Alongside rounding out the brawler and chrono traits for the comp, Blitz provides a key strategic advantage to the comp in terms of synergy with Teemo. Teemo always casts his shrooms at the closest enemy. Blitz will act as a way to group more  s together at the beginning of the fight for teemo to cast on. Even if your opponent positions for your Blitz, at the end of the day, his pull will group more enemies together which allows for your teemo to do more damage. This is also why Teemo is positioned in the middle of the back row instead of the far side.    ;  **Why Line The Frontline in a Row?**  Again, the goal is to maximize the grouping of enemy champions. By not spreading out your frontline and Blitz pulling additional  s in, enemy  s bunch up more which is good for: Teemo's DPS, Naut's frontline ult, Gnar's ult, and Wukong's ult so he has to travel less distance. Each of your frontline  s directly benefit from clusters of enemy champions.    ;  #3. Leveling, Econ, and Rolling:  This comp is very dependent on 4-cost champions. Therefore, pushing levels is vital for completing the build earlier and losing less hp against the more aggressive meta that we are in.    ;  **Level 4**  Immediately level to 4 on 2-1. You need to begin acquiring 2 and 3-cost champions sooner and an early bard will give you a large advantage later in the game. Ahri, Jayce, and Bard are great at this stage in the game. If you see Karma, pass her up. She will take away from your econ if you pick her up before Krugs.    ;  **Level 5**  Go to level 5 after the stage 2 carousel. You should be at level 5 and 10 gold on 2-5. Now you have a chance at a lucky 4-cost.    ;  **Krugs**  Try to be at 20-30 gold and 80 health at the completion of Krugs.    ;  **Level 6**  If you hit an early game Bard and you have sufficient gold, go to level 6 after Krugs. If you did not hit early Bard or you are poor, go to level 6 at 3-2. Again, the goal is to speed up access to 4-cost champions as this build uses 5 of them. If you hit Soraka at this point in the game, do not buy her as she is your level 8 addition.    ;  **Level 7**  Wolves should be the latest you level to 7. If you hit an early Bard or have the gold to hit level 7 with 40 gold left over, do so after the stage 3 carousel. If I am weak, I will roll to 30 gold at level 7.    ;  **Level 8**  On a typical game, you should level to 8 when you have enough money to hit 8 and roll down ~40 gold (Typically around the stage 4 carousel). However, if you hit  s early, Bard gave you a ton of exp, or have the health to wait, this is when you decide if you are going to 9 or not. If healthy and strong like GV8's Mom, then level to 8 and maintain 30 gold. This gold will get you to 9.    ;  **Level 9**  If you are lucky enough to hit level 9, it is most likely a top 3. This is when you get to decide on if you   a 2nd 2-  Teemo in your line up or a Thresh. I prefer a 2nd Teemo, but any strong champion in the 9th slot will work.    ;  #4. Bard - When to Use: Pray for the early game Bard boys. He will change the trajectory of your game in terms of leveling and econ. Feel free to slam an attack speed item or two on him. However, if you hit your first Bard after Krugs or if you are bleeding out HP, Bard's time on your roster has passed. Big boi is not worth having on your team if you are getting demolished every round and he only gets 1 cast off.    ;  #5. Items and Carousel Priority: As mentioned in the title, Teemo is your main carry. This means that his items are priority. Blue Buff is your most important item. Be sure to go for tears and rods for the first few carousels. Teemo can use Blue Buff alongside Morello's, Death Cap, or Ludens. Morellos is the 2nd most  important right now because of all the 4 Mystic players. Speaking of 4 Mystic trash, they take your tears on carousel. Watch for which players are going Cassiopeia as it may be worth inting a round or two to get a pick before them.  After completing Blue Buff and 1 AP item for Teemo, it's time to switch to Jhin. Last Whisper is Jhin's most important item followed by IE. After those two are complete feel free to make a Death Blade, Giant Slayer, Hurricane, whatever the game gives you feel free to slam after those two priority items.    ;  #6. Infiltrators: Infiltrators can give you a rough time with the standard positioning, especially an infil Irelia. If you are going up against an Infiltrator player, adjust your positioning to bring Gnar into the back row where the infil is jumping and position your carries away using the mystics as a buffer. Gnar will provide a tanky target that infils get stuck on and he can CC  s away from the carries.    ;  #7. Beware of Spats: They almost always turn out to be dead unless you make a Celestial Spat and opt for Lulu over Soraka or get a FoN.    ;     ;  #Tips on 1-Tricking With Consistent Success:    ;  #1. Select a Comp That Can Utilize Every Item: If you are going to force a comp every game with consistent success, there must be flexibility within your inflexibility. Some games, creeps are going to drop you nothing but swords and bows. Other games, you may get an abundant amount of rods and tears. I struggled with my trips to Challenger as   Guardian only and Mana Printer only when non-optimal items dropped for me as they were often wasted. However, my trip to Challenger with Void only seemed incredibly smooth in comparison because Void had an ADC and an AP carry which meant no item was wasted. Part of the reason why I chose my current 1-trick build was because it provided options as to which champion would be the main carry and which champion would be the off carry based off of my creep item drops.    ;  #2. Select a Build That Can Viably Support More Than 1 Player: Again, reflecting on the SG, Mana Printer, and Void climbs, the latter two were far easier. Mana Printer required no 2- s for a top finish and Void's 3- s were all 1-costs which can easily be hit by more than 1 player. As a 1-trick you are going to be contested in some games. It is favorable to you if the build you are running does not depend on 3- ring two and three cost champions.    ;  #3. Do Not 1-Trick a Comp That Depends Heavily on Hitting a 5-Cost: This game has a large element of RNG in it. Depending on hitting a 5-cost to round out your comp can be very risky depending on the game. If you look through all of my guides, you will notice that all of them are lacking a 5-cost in the core build. 4-cost carries are extremely powerful and can be reliably hit on a consistent basis. I love to use 5-cost champions to add power to my builds at level 9, but in terms of the core level 8 comp, they are notably excluded.    ;  I'll be around to answer questions if you have them.  **- The Great Lakes**", "id": "ha7iqh", "num_comments": 149, "created_utc": 1592325572}, 
{"title": "Challenger Initial Thoughts on 10.12 Meta and Brief Meta Comps Guide - Chatskiiees", "author": "Chatskiiees", "selftext": "Hey Reddit! I'm a challenger player in all 3 sets of tft on OCE and also Challenger in Set 3 on NA. I am also Master on OCE for set 3.5. You may have seen a similar post by me regarding the [10.7 patch]  and [10.8 patch]  which after a little hiatus to grind snapshots  I've decided to do again! After playing 30 or so games on the first day in challenger lobbies, many pbe games and challenger in-house lobbies i have a pretty good idea about which comps will be strong. Use this as a way to get  ted in 10.12 until the meta settles and maybe get a little free LP before everyone catches on. If you have any questions feel free to leave them here or ask me on my stream ([twitch.tv/chatskiiees]  i should be live for the next 12 hours or so grinding back to rank 1 shortly after this this post goes live. Let's get into it!  # Key Information (Gameplay)  * The flow of the game, like at the beginning of all new patches, heavily favours win-streaking. Win-streaking generally is always better than lose-streaking but even more so at the beginning of a new patch. Playing from behind when uncomfortable with compositions and   strengths is a recipe for disaster. Consider lose streaking when playing heavily contested comps that require specific items, but remember its always a gamble; Inting for protector asol spat will lose you more games than it will win you. * The ability to sell  s for their full gold -1 (except 1    s) makes the game much more difficult in my opinion. One of the biggest mistakes I've seen people do on this patch is get baited by upgraded  s. Sure its reasonable to upgrade  s and run them instantly in order to win streak and save health, and this is what you should be doing,  but you have to have a good understanding on the strength of  s vs. the strength of synergies in order to transition before you bleed out. Make sure you play a lot of games and figure out which  s are good to keep and which ones need to go. For example, mort has said space pirates spike at 2-6, the round where they have the highest winrate, then begin to fall off. Knowing when to take out that early spike for synergies is pivotal, especially when holding a 2   Darius can cost you econ. * Speaking of econ, how you are managing your econ depends heavily on two things on 10.12. The first is the galaxy you are playing on. Most people understand the need for adaptation on specific galaxies and many are self evident (you can trade health for money in medium legends for example) but ensure you aren't trading one too heavily over the other. Furthermore, when you  t playing in higher elos against the same players every game, your typical econ strategy becomes very easy to read and counter-able. Consider playing against the norm on galaxies in order to press advantage when you are comfortable with your position. A tip i always give on my stream is that the game isn't just about making yourself win, it's about making the other players lose. The second thing it relies on is your rng. Play off what you hit and attain a complex understanding of board strength. Understanding your relative strength to the lobby and assessing that based on your health total is probably the most important skill in TFT. * My favourite thing about 3.5 is that you can play 3 cost carries, 4 cost carries or 5 cost carries. The rebel patch that  ted set 3 was 5 cost carries, then it was 4 cost carries, then back to 5 then bang bros but now there's a lot of diversity. Vayne, Cassio, Syndra, yi and probably a few others can all hold carry items and be predominant damage dealers. 3 cost carries have also been buffed by the pool changes to 3 cost  s (16-18), as well as the fact that you now have a 30% chance to find 3 costs at 9 as opposed to 25%. * Speaking of carries, multiple instances of damage is key to comp success on this patch. Save for a few comps that have synergies revolving around particular  s (like mech or prot. asol) there exists so much damage and target removal (looking at you urgot you big fucking boi) that you can easily get unlucky in a teamfight and lose 20+ hp. Consider splitting carry items where possible (gs irelia and gs vayne is better than two gs irelia in a lot of circumstances) * Reroll comps for 1 *  s are pretty dead, the addition of two 1 cost  s and removal of only 1 ruins the pool a little, but more so they can't keep up with the new big bad motherfuckers in 3.5. What can xayah do when its kfc time for urgot PepeHands. * Riot have said they   to push the game away from linear comps that run 6 of the same  s, like   guardians, sorcs, cybers but that is really not the case anymore. Running your end game synergies like 4 prots, 4 snipers 6 cyber etc. is key to late game now. Understanding when to sell your upgraded  s to spike off synergies is extremely important (ties in what i was saying about people getting baited by upgraded  s). * Reroll comps are fine but risky. Reroll comps have always had a pretty good late game generally as 3 *  s are obviously better than 2 *  s and the general relative strength of a 3 * two cost is slightly above a 2 * 4 cost. Protector reroll is definitely the best reroll comp, but i've seen people have success with rebels and vanguards, though vanguards is probably the worst of the 3 due to everyone running them for sniper early game.  # Key Information ( s/Synergies)  * Most  s that were in set 3 have kept their niche (its too early to tell if there's a substantial change in what a    s to do in a comp) but there are some important notes for new and old  s. * BARD IS A MONSTER BAIT 99% OF THE TIME. Guys i understand. Bard is a cutie pie and hes a money machine that you just   to run him every time but seriously don't. The trade off of losing 20% of your  s at 5, 16.66% at 6, 14% at 7 is monstrous when you think about it that way. The only time i run this   is if i get a lucky two   and i'm running some kind of cassio carry. Also if u neeko this on neekoverse i'm gonna find you and kill you (in game). * The new one costs are ok idk what else to say they do their job and 2 infiltrator is always gonna be a good early game. * The relative strength of 5 cost  s has gone way up. Ekko, Asol, Urgot, Janna, Gangplank (as always) etc. are all game changing when used correctly. Some of them can be run in a variety of comps to increase strength (like janna or ekko) but these are going to be win conditions in certain comps. Item stacking these  s is probably your best bet post stage 4-7 pve. * All the new 4 costs (except riven) are pretty good. Vik Gnar and Teemo are all pretty good and fit the comps that they go into well, though gnar is the only one that is flexible he's kind of like the brawler wukong. You'll notice i left out riven cause she is pretty bad. I understand that she is good in 6 sorcerers but the late game for that comp is pretty mediocre at best. Sure you can win games with it but whenever i play 6 sorcs i find myself prioritising viktor, mech or xerath instead. Theres just no way i'd rather run qss / rabadons /ga on a riven 2 over a qss guinsoo on a xerath. Consider using her as an item holder for xerath/gangplank. * Cassio is super item dependent but really good when she has blue buff morello. Vayne is the same, very effective with items and worthless without. * Vanguards   brawlers almost always. Vanguards are just way more effective and flat hp while effective due to the red buff nerfs is just sub-optimal when compared to a massive armor boost.  * It's really early but if i had to rate 6 battlecast out of 10 i'd give it a hard 0 this synergy does pretty much nothing but someone remind me in a week if 6 battlecast becomes meta and you guys can laugh at me. The synergy is just so much weaker than the other ones and the  s are all pretty mediocre since they are predominantly 1-2 costs. Urgot doesn't really benefit from the buff much aswell compared to say kog, who is kind of weak as a 3 *. We will see though.  * Zed is the new early game lucian he kinda nutty. Run him as ad item holder in cybers/rebels (remake him in rebels later.) * 4 protector is gross lmao expect hot fix, good thing this comp sucks when contested or we would have another 10.6 fiesta on our hands. * Mystic gonna get nerfs too. Consider pivoting to 4 mystic late game at the cost of some of your supporting synergies where necessary.  # Key Information (Items)  * Blue buff change was a really good idea by riot it makes the game much more easier to balance. All this really did was kill overpowered strategies like ziggs 3 * and syndra double seraphs. * IE is a really good item on alot of  s now. Guaranteeing crits on comps that scale highly with attack damage and flat damage buffs such as cybers and rebels creates a nutty combination. It's sad that last whisper provides 20% crit chance so in conjunction you are losing alot of value (yo mort just change ie to 80% and add like 10% crit dmg yea i know hire me riot balance team) but the two items work well together that its worth the trade off. IE + GS   IE + LW in my opinion. * Chalice is in that weird 'good but i'm never thinking about making it' niche that tft has always had. It's like zhekes, good but just make it when you can't make the items you actually need. The only thing i'll say about this though is that if you already have ionic spark this can be really helpful in sorc comps if you don't need tear but who doesn't need tear in sorcs? * Warmogs is the new wave you heard it here first boys and girls slam this shit ASAP. Chucking this on xin 2 will get you all the way to stage 4 easy breezy and the best part about this item is that its a tank item and a carry item! Giving 1 0 hp to your jinx, irelia, wukong, xin, urgot, gangplank, asol you name it just never feels terrible. Make sure you finish your core items first however. * Giant slayer really good run it on your jinx your yi your vayne even your mech! (ok maybe not mech but some people think its good, i don't personally.) * Titans resolve is really good now they didn't change it but if you run this on mech or xin it will put in monster work. Maybe because there are alot of tanks running around fights are slower so this has a lot of value. Bramble is probably close now in priority not sure which is better but generally bramble since it beats ie and has a better early game. * I don't think i've seen anyone make bloodthirster in 40 games but i think gunblade is a little underrated where you can fit it on an ap carry. I've won a few games playing ga seraph gunblade viktor in 6 sorcs. * Ludens is pretty good, slam it if you wanna winstreak or save the components if you are a greedy boy like me. The main takeaway is that it isn't useless late game and gets a lot of value on  s with low mana pools like cassio or ziggs.  # 10.12 Team Compositions  (A+/S++++ (No asol/Asol)) [4 Mystics Protectors]  Protectors are back and yea its just as annoying as last time. Xin lives forever, eats everyone, and rakan thinks its fun to knockup your whole team for no reason. Urgot 2 makes this comp giga busted and a perfect item of this comp (in the [asol]  version) is pretty much a guaranteed 1st. The skill expression on this comp comes with your personal discipline. You have to know when its a 3  ring xin game and when its a push levels game. Typically, i push levels with early spat to find asol as soon as possible, or when contested. If uncontested, i'll make a decision on 4-1 whether i'm going to keep rolling ( i typically slowroll on 6 to find all my upgraded protectors and cassio 2) or going to push levels. Cassio 3 is the win condition in this comp without asol. 9 for 4 celestial in both variations.   *You can also play 4 mystics with 4 vanguards with cassio carry, but this is weaker and typically lacks damage in the late game without 3 * cassio. You can win with this comp if you winstreak with 4 vanguards however, as you will usually last till top2-3. Run xin items on wukong.  (S) [Astro Snipers]  This comp is the bread and butter of NA right now but gets very little play in my region, between 0-2 a game. The comp however is still very effective. 4 Snipers seems core from my experience as 2 snipers doesn't let jhin carry fast enough and your frontline gets overwhelmed. There is debate on BIS for jhin but nothing beats double runanas dblade in my opinion. IE/LW/GS are all fine however. You can also prioritise a xerath 2 with guinsoo if you are playing a heavy vanguard lobby. Teemo items are very important in this comp as well do not overlook them, jhin is priority however. Go 9 for mystic 9 is key for this comps success in the late game.  (A+) [Cybernetiks]  My personal favourite comp has a new friend in vayne and she's pretty lit. This comp plays fairly linearly but the debate comes in the form of irelia carry or [vayne]  carry. Personally, i prefer irelia, especially when uncontested as 3 * 4 costs when you are winstreaking is pretty reliable when uncontested, but vayne 3 also packs a big punch. The items are BIS for irelia and vayne imo. Celestial feels really bad to run now with no kassadin. If you are running vayne play jhin for sniper and if you are playing irelia play blademasters. Go 9 for thresh or fizz if you have good ekko items.  (A+) [Rebels]  days of ziggs rebel is over so we back to jinx. The jinx nerfs are noticeable significantly on 3   jinx but two   jinx feels as good as ever. People might condemn me for saying firecannon is best in slot but honestly try it out and you'll never go back. You can reroll with this comp if you are close to hitting or are on trade sector but for the most part i go straight to 8. Play 6 rebels at 7 with blaster and it should carry you to 8 where you can play ekko or gangplank. Ekko is exceptionally good in this comp with zed granting infiltrator and the stasis effect of ekkos ult allowing asol to drain the opponents mana ( as he continues flying during stasis). Play whichever 5 * you don't have in at 9 (gangplank or ekko) though sometimes i skip gangplank if no ga or no upgrades and keep malphite, running gnar alongside him for more frontline, taking out ziggs. Run Urgot over gangplank or ekko if you hit protector spat for asol and i've even had success playing 6 rebel 4 protector at 9 with asol protector.  (A-S-S+??) [Sorc Mech]  [standard Variations]  of this comp is  probably what i'm most unsure of, though i have played a lot of games of each type. Sorc mech is definitely strong as a comp, 3 piece mech with titans and 6 sorc just obliterates teams. Viktor is typically my carry in this comp unless i play the 6   guardian variant. Viktor positioning is extremely important and viktor 3 is the win con (beating any other comp ive found including prot asol.) Play to reach level 7 deciding what variation of 6 sorcs to play (  guardians, mech, riven, viktor or gangplank) rolling till you have the core  s and a holder for rabadons/ga (viktor/riven ahri 2 etc.) . If i get   guardian spat i run viktor carry. I mostly play the mech variant with viktor carry. What you put in at 9 depends on which comp you run.      (B At best) Blaster brawler i mean this is probably still ok cause jinx is good but don't play this. Same as ever just another blaster over mf and gnar over cho. I know from experience this comp for reddit is like the gospel truth but seriously this is just worse than the other comps. Play it if you don't like having to think.  (D) 6 Dark s / 6 Battlecast / 6 Chrono   # Final Thoughts and TL:DR  Thank you so much once again for reading my guide on the 10.12 patch and i hope you got something out of it. I expect the accuracy of my predictions to be on par with the last and i reiterate that the meta may change but this guide should get you  ted well. Make sure you aren't hard forcing any of these comps unless you are extremely confident in doing so as the game is extremely balanced right now and it is better to play based on what items/ s you hit. Play comps and watch streams (like mine at [twitch.tv/chatskiiees]  to improve. Make sure you don't autopilot while playing and if you   to climb the game needs 1 % of your focus. Always remember that tft is like any sport/discipline in that imitation will only ever get you so far and true excellence requires creativity, adaptation and artistry. I'll be streaming this patch on my main in high OCE chally and doing lolchess/AMA for probably the whole day today! Feel free to leave comments below aswell i always try to answer them all.

{"title": "[10.12] Quick Mech Sorcs Guide Rank 1 OCE", "author": "97638 1", "selftext": "Hey guys Duskglade here, also known as Dawnglade. As of this post I'm currently rank 1 OCE after playing a bunch of mech sorcs on live. I first discovered how good the build was on PBE and kept it to myself so I could climb quickly on ranked reset. This build is good because mech got buffed and riven and viktor are amazing additions to sorcs so here's a quick guide to it. I actually think I'm a pretty terrible player so this build is carrying me hard (mid masters before reset).  Level 9 comp (6 sorcs):    Level 9 comp (4 sorcs):    Level 8 comp (4 sorcs):    Level 7 comp (4 sorcs Riven):    You play strongest board to level 7, picking up mechs and some sorcs along the way then roll at 7 for mech pilots, 1   riven, and 1   viktor until you stabilise from mech. Then go 8 after raptors and roll for missing 2  s + possibly 3   mech pilots depending on your mech items and hope you hit GP, Xerath, and maybe Janna. If you don't hit GP, Riven with good items can carry you to top 3 perfectly fine. Depending on how much econ you have and how strong you feel you can go 9 to guarantee your GP and make more room for 6 sorcs.  The comp is extremely flexible as you can work with any items, 2 * mech pilots and you have 4 different possible carries in GP, mech, riven, and viktor meaning it doesn't really matter if you get contested a little. Item priority is GP items   mech items   Viktor items, pick up rod at first carousel and if not then get tear or vest. Deathcap quicksilver and GA are the highest priority items.  Riven is your big item carrier for GP and a one   riven with deathcap GA can carry you all the way to raptors. Viktor is good dps but in my experience isn't strong enough to be your primary carry. Mech is amazing and can hold any leftover and non-ap items. Don't be afraid to play 2 * mech pilots without mech, they're really good even as standalone  s now. In late game you can work with Xerath Karma if you have guinsoos, Janna if you have a stacked mech, or just go plain old 6 sorcs. In the early game anything works, go cybers, blademasters, rebels, or whatever and slowly slot in 2   sorcs like Ahri and Syndra while trying to econ.

{"title": "How to Have a Pre-game Advantage When It Comes to Build Decisions", "author": "Klam48", "selftext": "Hi everyone - I  ed to share a tactic that I learned a few months ago that has provided me a great advantage when it comes to deciding what to build and helped me reach Master (despite not knowing how to transition or pivot): **LoLChess Research**  The idea behind this is quite simple:  1. Use a second monitor or a second computer to open up 7 LoLChess browsers (  2. Once your game  ts and you're at the loading screen, type each opponent's name in the LolChess browsers 3. Renew each opponent's page, so you get their most up-to-date stats, and check the summary page for builds 4. Based on what you see everyone else build, you can identify either look at your favorite builds and check to see which is the least likely to be cut off. 5. Enjoy the improved RNG!  The reason why this works well is that the majority of TFT players only have a set amount of builds. I don't have data to back this up, but I'd estimate this as so:  | # of Unique Builds a Player Has In Their Repertoire|Low ELO (silver/gold)|High ELO (diamond/master Level)| |:-|:-|:-| |1|40%|20%| |2|30%|30%| |3|20%|30%| |4+|10%|20%|      To get an idea of how different profiles would look, here are three examples:      *1 Build Forced:*      [More common at lower levels, but still occurs even at Challenger  (e.g., forced Void Brawlers )]   *2 Builds Forced:*      [More common in general where someone chooses between two main builds  (e.g., 2 /3 6 Rebels and 1 /3 Jhin Variations )]   *3+ Build Player:*     [More common at high ELO - someone who likely plays based off the situation and scouting]       I, myself, know only three builds: Blaster Brawler, Mech Infiltrators, and Shredder (Hyperroll Celestials), and I always used to pick based on my first set up champs and items. However, I realized that the most important thing, based on my playstyle, was understanding who may be cutting me off. Since I only have those three builds in my repertoire, I check all seven opponents LolChess accounts for similar builds and see which one is the least common - and I'll choose to play the least common build among them. I'll compare who plays 4 Celestials vs. 4 Blasters or Brawlers more, as well as if anyone plays Mech in general, and whichever is the least cutoff is the one I'll go for. The beauty of this is it's allowed me to jump from mid-Diamond to Master, despite my ineptitude to pivoting.      Hope this research helps you all out as much as its helped me!", "id": "gthj5f", "num_comments": 54, "created_utc": 1590858126}, 
{"title": "Void Only Challenger Guide", "author": "dennisj9", "selftext": "Hi All,  It's [The Great Lakes]  your favorite 1-tricking Challenger assistant principal.   Each patch I pick a comp to 1-trick to Challenger. A few patches ago I ran [  Guardian Only]  to Challenger, last patch was [Mana Printer Only]  to rank 40, for patches 10.10 and 10.11 I played only Void Brawlers to Challenger.  Other guides have been published on Void Brawlers, but I   to give some key insights on how to ensure consistent top finishes, especially when in contested lobbies.    ;  **Let's get to it.**    ;  #1. Ideal Positioning and Level 8 Comp:  [**Level 8 Comp and Default Position**]   This is what the dream looks like, boys. (We'll talk about Fizz later) Listen closely because there are a few key reasons why I've found a lot of success with running this positioning.    * The decision making for positioning each round is reduced to two choices if there are no shrouds or zephyrs:    * **Kha'zix:** Kha'zix needs to be in a good spot to reach carries without aggroing too many other champs.  * **Blitz:** You need to decide which side you would like blitz to pull from by moving him left or right by 1 or 2 tiles.   * With positioning taking very little of your cognitive capacity you can devote more time to shooting the shit in chat which is very key if you   an entertaining TFT experience.    * Kha should typically be jumping to the same side Blitz is pulling from. Blitz removes the   protecting the carry while Kha gets a better opport y to get on the carry.  * This positioning protects yourself from other infiltrator players by having everything lined up in the backline.  * I've been running this positioning with Malph in the 2nd row since the beginning of patch 10.10 as it's ideal to have enemy champions get stuck on Malphite (especially mana reavers) and draw the aggro of midline champions slightly quicker, so they don't turn around on your infiltrators. This seems to be even more vital with the new infiltrator changes.    ;  #2. Early Game/Stage 2: [Your Strongest Econ Efficient Early Game Board]   Ahri would work as an item holder instead of Kai'sa, but she currently has a bug that delays her from casting at full mana half the time and it's been incredibly frustrating to watch, so i opt for Kai'sa as of now.  Throughout stage 2, you are not rolling or leveling at all. Your job is to make a team that prevents you from bleeding out too much health, while still giving you the opport y to hit important econ targets.  Ideally, at Krugs, you should have 40 gold and at least 80 HP if the round went alright. You are going to lose from HP in the early game, this is alright, but it will become a factor in your next decision.    ;  #3. Hyper Roll vs Slow Roll. Forgive me Socks, for I have sinned. I have forsaken your teachings and hyperrolled  sometimes.  Aight boys, listen closely because each strategy has its place and use. There is a decision you need to make at Krugs.    ;  **Slow Roll:** This is my go to strategy. Hit 50 gold after Krugs and roll down to 50 gold each round saving TF's, Malphites, and Kha. Level to 6 after 3- ring Kha'Zix. I roll with this strategy if after Krugs I'm chilling with at least 50 gold and 80 HP.     ;  **Hyper Roll:** This is the emergency plan. If at the conclusion of Krugs you have 65 HP or roughly 30 gold, this is when things need to change or you're going to take a fast 8th. Roll like your life depends on it, because it does. You need a power spike immediately or you will be out of the game. Or, your econ is so far from being able to slow roll, that you can't begin to slow roll until after carousel, you need to give up on that strategy and just roll now on 3-1.  This is also the high roll plan. If Krugs roll around and you find yourself with 6 or 7 Kha'Zix, you go for that brother. This is going to save you a lot of HP in the end and hopefully you will only need to hyper roll down to 20-30 gold, which allows you to  t econning again fast.    ;  #4. When To Give Up on Kha: Something I see often from contesting players, is they don't give up on 3- ring Kha'Zix. Brother let me tell you something, Kha'Zix is not your most important   in this comp. It is perfectly acceptable to move on and  t leveling without 3- ring Kha'Zix.  At the beginning of 4-1, If I have 7 or 8 Kha, I'll roll to 40 or 50 one last time to hit 3-  Kha'Zix. At 4-2, I level to 6 no matter what and gun for level 7 by the end of carousel. If you spend too much time and too much gold after 4-1 going for Kha, you're essentially sealing your fate. Many players in the lobby are going to be level 8 immediately after carousel and you will have no chance in those fights, costing you the remainder of your HP.  As a 1-trick, I sometimes find myself in a lobby with 2 or more players pulling from the Kha'Zix pool. If there is more than 1 player contesting you, give up on 3- ring Kha'Zix immediately and focus on leveling. Continue to save your 1-costs obviously, but let them spend their resources on trying to out 3-  each other. It will pay off in the long run if you do.    ;  #5. Vel'Koz is Your Most Important  . While a 3-  Kha'Zix can carry you through the mid game, the real hero on your team is Vel'Koz. He will be your highest damage dealer in every round if itemized. Giving up on 3- s in alright because this homie will be the one to carry you across the finish line.    ;  #6. Carousel On the first carousel, I go for a BF sword, Bow, or Glove just like any other chump. Slamming an item on Kha'Zix early will help you in the early and mid game.  However, after that initial carousel, it's Vel'koz time. You will notice in my match history that my Vel'Koz almost always has perfect items, but my Kha'Zix gets scraps. Especially after the Infiltrator and Kha'Zix nerfs, prioritizing Kha'Zix and his items is something I would not recommend.    ;  #7. Double Seraph's vs. QSS: If you can get it, go for the double Seraph's. You will notice many of my games with my Vel'Koz holding a QSS, this is not by choice, but because I had to give up on obtaining 4 tears. The majority of my first place finishes with Void Brawlers has been when Vel'Koz has a double Seraph's.  QSS is good, don't get me wrong, but fights shift dramatically in your favor when Vel'Koz gets to ult within the first 2 seconds of the fight. Applying Morellos and removing multiple enemy champions at the very  t of the fight has paid off more than the protective quality of QSS.    ;  #8. Fizz vs Second Cho'gath: Like most other players I will put a Fizz in at level 8. However, if at any point I come across a second 2-  Cho'gath. That big boy is going in and Fizz is coming out. I personally find Fizz to be an underwhelming champion and I do not prioritize Kha'Zix, which is the only champion who benefits from the Infiltrator trait. However, Cho was recently buffed and benefits from both true damage and max brawler. If your Fizz is still 1- red, it may be worthwhile to replace the 1-  Fizz with a 1-  Cho at this point.    ;  #9. 3- ring 4-Costs or Level 9?: Since I am already trying to collect 6 Cho, I personally opt for attempting to 3-  my 4-cost void champions. After hitting level 8, I'll try to roll down to 20-30 gold. If at any point I hit 7 or 8 of Cho or Vel, I will roll all the way down. 3- ring either of these champions is a solid win condition. The only time I go for 9 is if I know there have been too many Cho or Vel taken from the pool to be worth attempting.    ;  #10. Counters: Obviously being contested will weaken you overall. However, these are things that can easily be overcome by pushing levels at obtaining a 2-  Vel'Koz.  Old shredder has given me issues in the past, but since the nerf, no specific comp has been a significant obstacle. However, nothing quite ruins my day like a well placed Shroud. Be sure to scout for Zephyr's and Shrouds, but sometimes a cheese shroud or Zephyr at the beginning of the round is unavoidable. This comp only has two significant damage dealers, so these items can have a large impact on you.    ;  I'll be around to answer questions if you have them.  **The Great Lakes aka Leona Gone Wild**", "id": "gst788", "num_comments": 154, "created_utc": 1590759625}, 
{"title": "New Sorcerer candyland/gp build", "author": "tftwinnicott", "selftext": "Hello, i'm Winnicot, a high elo tft player, i have been playing since season one, i did not play season 2, but recently i came back to teamfight tactics, in the season 1 i hit with two accounts challenger in LAS, Grand master in Na and diamond in br, actually i'm in diamond (i came back a week ago) and i noticed that the current meta is changing very fast so i tried to do a new build.  As you well know, actually the meta is Jinx and brawlers, Jhin and friends, Mecha and void brawlers also shredder xayah, but sometimes u just don't like these comps or they are very contested so u can't do much agaisnt them so this is a guide, and a build to have a decent early with an strong transition in late game.  You probably know this build \"6 sorcerer, gangplank and rumble\". but this is a guide to how to get into the late game, get atleast top 4 without dying in the try.  **Search my instagram page \"Tft.winnicott\". I post guides and some useful tips for tft.**  So the main build should look like this   [You add jayce in level 9 if needed or just stay at 8 with gp 2.]   This build is well known but what i'm bringing today is the way to get to this result. The main problem of candyland actually is that you get stomp by void brawlers or almost everything in mid-late game so its a safe 6th place build if u only run straight as candyland. But today, i'm bringing the way to end on the first place.  In early game u   to get the strongest board (as always) but focused on Poppy and something to do damage, like this.   Item carrusel priority =  Large rod   B.F Sword   Chain vest.   Item priority =  Rabadon Deathcap's   Guardian Angel   Morellonomicon   Economy = High roll after golems, Ecoin and waste residual gold on leveling and getting sorceres at two  s, when u feel strong enough,  t pushing levels.  ***Standard early game.***  [You add ahri in lv 4 and you can add another sorcerer or go with space pirates if need to.]   So thats the standard begin, but there is another way to do this build. there is another variation for early game. this one is a bit more aggressive  ***Early game variation.***  [You use blizcrank to grab the carry and darius oneshot him.]   So, for the golems, you have to roll down for poppy 3  s (in the standard build) and play candyland as you always played it. something like this for mid game  ***Standard Mid game.***  [you use poppy 3  s as item holder since she does not have value in late game.]   The other mid game variation is the space pirates one, it looks like this.  ***Mid game variation.***      [Here if u don't have velkoz can use, tf, syndra or any sorcerer, you use darius and jayce for item holder.]   So at this point of the game, u should've dominating, probably in the first 4 places with like 70+ health points, by the econ that you've done, u can keep pushing levels and have alot of health points to find gangplank.  So at the 4-5 you should be econing for push to level eight and get gangplank.  In level 8, roll down, get gangplank and get your final comp.   Here i will add some variations for the final build.   Variation 1 Candy boom Mechas.      [At level 9 u can run this variation and is extremely strong.]   I hope you enjoy my guide and build, i apologyze for my bad english, my main language is spanish so i hope you can understand it.

{"title": "[MASTER] How to play the new Sniper+Vanguard/Space-Jam build(Fairly long guide with positioning strategies vs some top comps).", "author": "villos16", "selftext": "Hey guys, just  ed to preface that this is my first guide so I am open to constructive criticism and opinions, anyways hope you like my guide :)      I won't claim this as an original build, I've seen keane and other people play this a few times with other variations.      Lets  t with some pros and cons:   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Pros:**  1. Mainly relies on Jhin carry, which is relatively uncontested in the current moment. 2. Very flexible build based on what you hit. 3. Can make use of multiple \"useless\" items such as cloak or belts. 4. Does not rely on legendary  s, although if you   a 1st you may need a few or some 3  s. 5. Does fairly well vs Kayle/Jinx and shredder with decent enough positioning and items.      **Cons:**  1. Some  s in your comp are heavily contested. 2. A bit difficult to pivot into due to having specific contested  s. 3. Will lose to void brawlers / Dark  s unless you roll better  s or items than them. 4. Not hitting your core  s early will cost you vital hp. 5. To secure 1st you need the BiS damage items for Jhin and a defensive item which varies based on the top 4 players.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Core  s:**      I won't show any early game boards, I feel like you might get baited into always going for this build even though you should always be flexible and try to go for any uncontested comps.      These are the 6 core  s, last 2  s is totally up to you, can be either 2 mystic, GP + A demo if you have GA, Kayle + MF if you can support it, You can Swap out Darius for Thresh Late game. You can even Run 2 brawlers Cho + Vi/Blitz. Even Xerath plus a Karma if you have perfect items for him.             Items shown here are BiS, Darius can be the 1st priority for items if you think you can 3   him. Otherwise a 2   darius with 1 rod item can easily carry you through mid-game, because you may sell him later on in the game.      Side-note:  I tried to do go the old Space-Jam, with Rakan and Xin and it just didn't feel strong enough, maybe on treasure trove this might be okay?, I also have a bias for Wukong, his recent buffs are so good.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Jhin's Defensive Item:**  The reason Why I have this highlighted is because this item matters the most based on the lobby so make the decision if you wanna just hit top 4 or make the right defensive item to get a potential 1st.      Vs. Infiltrators (Mech or Void Brawlers)  Always grab a GA, Accept the fact that your jhin is gonna die, its fine, he'll resurrect and continue dealing damage.      Vs. Kayle/Mf+Jinx comps  QSS or Trapclaw, QSS if they have a zephyr and trying to snipe jhin, Otherwise trapclaw to try to let Jhin tank MF ult or Kayle's Autos.      Vs. Shredder  GA/Sword-Breaker, You may be thinking \"Isn't sword-breaker an offense item?\", yes while it may be an offense item, you can put it on your Jhin if you have a Runaan's on him aswell, you can hit the fiora/irelia, and the cait/ashe in the back at the same time, potentially disarming them and buying you more time. Otherwise grab GA, I like to position Jhin same side as the Shredder because we don't   Jhin to  t auto-attacking the Shen.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Positioning Strategies:**  1.Blasters  A trick you can do to preserve your trapclaw for long as possible is to position Jhin on the same side as Vi and MF if you can, yes you will lose out on some sniper damage due to less range, but it keeps Jhin in an angle where he can shoot and keep safe, here's an example:         The idea is to make sure Jhin doesn't get ulted by Vi or Blitz, and have him tank MF ult with Trapclaw to stun her. If you have QSS, you can tank the Blitz hook and corner Bhin safely, if he has MF, Blitz And Vi on the same side you can just send Ashe to that side to use her as a bait. if the blaster player constantly switches sides for their Vi, MF and Blitz, follow his side accordingly, always ensure Jhin is never the target for Vi or Blitz if you can help it.  2.Kayle      Ideally we wouldn't   Jhin to auto-attack the Shen, try to keep Jhin on the opposite side of Kayle, if the Kayle player has Shen in the middle with Kayle on one side you have to same side the Jhin with Kayle, we cannot waste time with Jhin auto-attacking the Shen.               3.Mech  Now this is a bit tricky, as Kiyoon said, good Mech players always one side the Mech instead of spreading out. The ideal scenario is to isolate Jhin and have him die to Kha'Zix, you can keep another ranged   such as Ashe nearby, but that may result in your other  s exploding to Kai'sa, ideally Ashe can ult before dying thus stunning the nearby infiltrators and buying time. If it comes down to you and a Mech player for top 2, accept the fact Jhin is gonna die, if the Mech player is good. Make sure you have a GA on him to ensure optimal positioning, or you can frontline Jhin and keep some bait in the back.      Ideal position:           Frontline position:           4.Shredder      Should be fairly easy, unless its Treasure Trove and they have a Shojin Fiora or something lol, ideally you   Jhin to avoid hitting shen and have him die to AoE from Jayce/Wukong/Ashe, or Darius dunking him. if the Shredder player sandwiches Shen then you can go Opposite side of Xayah with Jhin and Ensure he kills everyone, leaving Xayah alone at the end. Shroud of stillness is good here because you can delay the enemy Shen Ult.              5.Void Brawlers  Sadly I do not have enough experience playing vs this comp, This will undoubtedly lose if the enemy has a 3   Vel'Koz or Cho'Gath with a zephyr. Some advice I can give is to ensure you have a GA cuz Kha'zix will surely kill Jhin here, try to one side the rest of your  s so Kha'zix won't chase Jhin when he revives. I will update this section when I have a better understanding of this match-up.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Conclusion:**  I am not sure where this comp falls on the tier list, you definitely struggle vs certain comps and you need to play reactively instead of forcing, who might give you the most trouble later on, should you go for this build or not. The main thing that stands out in this comp is the skill expression it has such as a kayle comp, you can mix and match a lot of stuff here, as Polt says \"I just play what I hit\". And you can definitely do that with this comp, I feel like Jhin is in an okay spot right now, he just hates Infiltrators xd. Also this might be irrelevant due to the Mid-Season patch coming up so oh well, glhf out there guys :D", "id": "gpnanf", "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1590315199},

{"title": "TFT Gameplan Guide: Master's Leauge Guide to a Solid Gameplan for Consistent, Standard Play", "author": "BermSwag", "selftext": "Hi there,      I am a Masters TFT player on NA. While I am not a tip top tier challenger player, and do not have the raw skills at this time to do that in my opinion, I have a solid gameplan that will do a lot for you in the current meta. My gameplan will do four major things for you that I think are important for climbing:      -Revolves around very standard, mechanically solid play, which will help players improve.    -Gives players a compositional range, which is the goldielocks of gameplans, better than heperrolling, or forcing one team comp, or coming in with no plan.    -Allows you to fluidly pivot between super solid comps based on your item income, game health, lobby strength and compositions, and of course your champion income.    -Almost completely eliminate bottom 2 finishes at your level.     Therefore, I'm going to boil down my approach and theory to three parts: Team comps, items, and champions.  I am not going to include specific gameplay details, because there is a ton of detail and content about that out there already. **However, if this guide is well-received, I can definitely make a step-by-step gameplay guide, if its something people would benefit from.**      This guide will be pretty long, and have a ton of solid information. I believe that all levels of players can find some benefit or insight in here, though the degrees will vary. At the very least, for the tip top challenjour players out there, this will provide some insight on how this pleb Masters player thinks about the game. I believe that Platinum and below players should be able to find all of this information extremely helpful.      **I love thinking and writing about this game. If you enjoyed, please let me know. I'd love to do more content if people like reading. I don't love piecing together graphics with guides.**      ***Please note that all of the things that I say are my opinions. You are more than welcome to disagree with them.***      **Background: (You can skip this if you  , this section is more of a preface and adds some context to the guide).**     I've played a bunch of games at reasonable levels. I was a high level SC2 player. I favor solid, defensive macro play, because I feel like it is both the most challenging way to play and the most rewarding when done correctly. As a legend Hearthstone player I favored decision-making decks, rather than more draw-reliant decks. I like playing and thinking about games like chess, poker, fantasy football, and board games like Terraforming Mars, Terra Mystica, Settlers of Catan, ect.     Why do I love these types of games? Two reasons: 1. I love being competitive, and as a pleb late 20s grad student who also works a fuckton, I don't have time to participate in a kickball league or some other extremely fun IM sports league. 2. I love decision-making, and the rewards that go with making great decisions, great gameplans, ect. That's what keeps me going, that's why I play games. This gameplan exemplifies some of that drive and desire to make decisions and pivots, while still operating within a solid framework.      **Team Comps**  So I believe firmly that as a player, you should have a range of compositions and pivots that you are comfortable making ingame. As you get better at the game, this catalog should get bigger and bigger, and have more and more flexibility. Additionally, your catalog should not be set in stone, but it should be a 97ish% to what you should be playing.     My team comps that are currently in my heavy rotation (in this order of personal preference):   -Blaster Brawler (Including the 2 blasters and 2 brawler flex variations)   -Cybernetics (Including all different level 8 and 9 flex variations)   -Chrono Kayle      So what does this 3-comp package do for me as a player? It gives me and my small brain a path to top 4. It lights the path. It gives me goals, and ideal champions. We will talk about this more in earlygame strategy. Some thoughts on the team comps:     **Brawler Blaster** has been my favorite composition for around 6 weeks now. I like it because it is a strong top 4 comp, allows you to be moderately flexible pre-8, allows you to have a decent-strong earlygame depending on your transitions and ability to find red buff(s). This comp can absolutely support more than one player. However, scouting boards for brawler holds is important and an easier way to predict than midgame blaster boards. As you'll see in my midgame gameplan, a blaster board can easily pivot to other top tier comps.  **Cybernetics** is a really good composition, and has been for a while. This comp has more item flexibility, while having less item flexibility, in the sense that you do require 2 really good Irelia items that are not slam-able flex items. I do not find IE or LW as good slams, as it limits your options heavily, whereas I believe that Jinx only has one item that is not slammable, GS, because you can slam defensive items, though not really always having a huge impact early, and you always always always slam red buff in this meta that focuses on earlygame, as well as some players hyperrolling.  **Chrono Kayle** is probably the strongest composition this patch. It is also the hardest to play and most contested composition this patch. It also requires very specific items, as Rageblade and RFC are not items that you   in almost any other composition. This is why I infrequently run this composition. However, an early random Kayle can be a free top-2 ticket. Again, I am not frequently running this composition, unless I find that early Kayle, or unless I get 2 bows PvE. At that point, you've got a leg up on the other people trying to force this build.  So why do I like these comps for my composition catalog? They play in similar ways, with no slow-rolling 6 or hyperrolling or anything like that. They come online at 7 or 8, you can always roll to stabalize, and are top 4 comps with lobby winning upside. Does this mean I don't know how to play the other comps? Absolutely not! I believe you should have fundamental knowledge of how to play all compositions, so that you can take advantage of super highrolls. Let me give you a couple of examples of times I have gone outside of my catalog in the last 6-8 weeks.      -I Lilac Nebula'd a Brawler's Glove Fizz, and orbed a Rumble on my first PvE round. I typed into chat \"Just super highrolled, going mech this game\". Top 1.   -Normal Galaxy, PvE gave me 4 Xayahs, IE and LW. Yes, I decided not to level at 2-1, hyperrolled shredder. Top 1.    -Normal Galaxy, first carousel first item, got a Chalice. PvE gave me a second chalice (this was during cancer printer time). Yes, I went Squid Battery. Top 1.     These are situations that you have to take advantage of. To do that, you still need to understand fundamentals of positioning, econing, transitioning, ect. of these comps, if you're playing at a reasonable level. That being said, these situations are one in 40 games. This is why you won't see me almost ever playing hyperrolling comps like shredder, candyland, willy wonka, or ziggs bomber, as well as slowroll comps like protectors, space jam, mech infiltrator, ect.  There is another, extremely core and important reason I don't play these comps, and stick to my catalog: Items.  **Items**  These are likely the most important indicators of what builds you should be focusing on in a lot of situations. You should have an excellent understanding of the items in this game. I can't tell you how important it is when you're trying to jigsaw puzzle everything together into completed items. *You need to understand your compositional needs in regard to core items and support items.*  A core principle of this grouping of composition is that there is a lot of overlap with some core and most support items. (So for those keeping track, the overlap in these comps includes econ/gameflow style, and item overlap.) One of the reasons that I don't often pivot into those other comps is that the core items are completely different. Protectors (last month) you had core Morello and Shojin for Rakan which doesn't fit other comps. Mech Infiltrator you need good mech items, Seraph Morellos for Kaisa (though you could argue that those are good MF items) as well as if you   to top 1 you need to be both uncontested and probably get demolition spatula item.  So here are all of the items in the game, some with thoughts, and some not with thoughts. I'm not going to go into super detail in some regard. Which is better between Shiv and Gunblade? Doesn't matter, they're both unplayable in 99% of games, and a waste of item components. So I'm not going into that much detail about it.     In general, remember that the goal should be to complete as many good items as possible, while fulfilling minimum requirements for your carries, as well as making absolute sure your main carry has a defensive item.  *S+ Tier:*   Red Buff: Best item for my strategy and in the meta currently. Helps you push through the earlygame and the midgame. Excellent in all our comps lategame for the debuff, especially with the emergence of redemption recently, fits everywhere. I can't tell you how much more important this item is than every other item for me. I prioritize it on carousels until I have at least one. If I am going brawler/blaster, I often like having two. Of course, your best red buff holders are Lucian  Ezreal   Graves. MF and Jinx are excellent red buff holders if you can't perfect their items.  *S Tier:*   The Defensive Trinity (GA, QSS, Trap Claw): You need a defensive item on your main carry, and you   a defensive item on your secondary carry. The ideal picks are all lobby dependent. If no infiltrators and numerous cranks, QSS is definitely the best so that you can corner your Kayle/MF. Trap claw is almost always optimal on Jinx, though again lobby and component dependent. You MUST have one of these items on your main carry, I can't stress that enough.     FoN: I don't utilize almost any spatula items, as none of the comps rely on them in final builds. If you get two spats, I almost always slam FoN. A very occasional exception would be if I have already committed going Cybers and have an extra bow, I will Infiltrator Spat Irelia, or I have committed to going Blaster/Brawler and have an extra chain vest, I will rebel spat someone. This is usually Blitzcrank or Ezreal or MF, depending on my defensive items, the amount of zephyrs/blitzcranks in the lobby, and if there are many AoE comps.  Giant Slayer: Very good in the current meta against the current frontliners. You don't have a priority for your BF Swords, other than one GA, unless you're going Cybers, and your bows also don't have a committed priority, unless you have multiple, in which case you should be gearing up for a Kayle comp. This item has a place in all 3 of our main compositions. I wouldn't slam a Giant Slayer unless you're fine with going Blaster/Brawlers 80ish% of the time, because if you're going Cyber or Kayle, you need the components. That being said, this is a core for Jinx, and if you have your prerequisite Red Buff, this is more than enough to head straight for a B/B comp.  *A Tier:*  Zephyr, Ionic Spark, Redemption, ZZrot (usually in that order): These are the excellent support items that fit into every comp at some level, though the amount of success depends on compositions and lobbies. In general, though, there are fundamentals that you should utilize with these items. Zephyr should go on a champion whose positioning is not critical, so that you have complete freedom to try and snipe carries or key tanks. Great Zephyr holders include Leona, Fiora, Graves, Vi, Blitzcrank (situational, as in B/B you don't   to move too far from your Jinx), Thresh. Great spark holders are Vi, Ekko, Chogath, Shen, Wukong. I think spark is A+ tier in Cybers. Great redemption and zzrot holders are pretty much anyone other than your carries, though you   your zzrot holder to hopefully be a 3   frontline, and you   your redemption owner to be someone on your frontline who won't drop opposing team aggro (Vi is not an ideal redemption holder for this reason.) Special shoutout to Cho for redemption.      Last Whisper, IEdge, RFC, Rageblade: You need to know what comp you're going when you complete these items (you can, though, sneak these items into Blaster/Brawler, though they are suboptimal). These are core carry items for Irelia and Kayle, and are borderline non-negotiable for these primary carries.  Thief's Gloves and Dragon Claw: Fit on everyone, almost never perfect or optimal, but never strictly bad. Dragon's Claw necessity varies from lobby to lobby. Shoutout to Ekko, Wukong, ChoGath, Vi, and sometimes MF as good Thief's Gloves holders.  Infiltrator Spat and Rebel Spat: See FoN  Morellonomicon: This is A- tier, but you can always find a place for this in any comp, which is why I'll keep it out of B. Good holders would be MF, ChoGath, Ekko, which pretty much covers all of the comps we will be playing.  *B Tier (There will be some items in here that some will put as A, but I will try to explain why)*  Bramble Vest: No hypertanks or draintanks like Xin, or Mech, that thrive with this item. If you 3 * a Shen, then this can be an A+ item on Shen. Due to the meta though, this isn't a bad item. Put on your beefiest boy.  Seraphs, Deathcap, HoJ: Non-essential, secondary carry items for the likes of MF and Ekko primarily. Still good, but not items you should prioritize. Seraphs is more flexible than the others, because tears are not important to us in this meta. If you don't have the belts required to put tears into Redemptions, then you can make a Seraphs.  Zekes and Locket: Flexible, always does something, but not quite as impactful as some of the other support items. Have slightly more value in Cyber comps, Zekes can be a crutch if you have a ton of belts and BF swords but are stuck going Kayle without enough bows. Always locket the frontline.  Blademaster, Celestial, and Demolitionist Spatula: These items can be interesting tech choices, but overall are only impactful situationally.  *C and below Tier (Obviously sometimes you'll have no choice, but these are not impactful or meaningful items in almost any games. Don't ever just slam these items after PvE rounds. A really good rule of thumb here is: don't make these items unless you have a very specific reason and justification for doing so, and no other item in a higher tier will do the trick)*  Deathblade: I haven't worked that much with new deathblade last 2 days. There is a chance this is a good item on Jinx, or maybe even Kayle/Irelia (but probably not).   Runaans, Shroud, Shojin, Ludens, Frozen Heart (slightly better than C tier on Ekko), Shield Breaker (slightly better in 4 blasters), Warmogs, Shiv, Gauntlet, Titan's Resolve, BT, Gunblade, Chalice: All have very little to no impact overall. Some can find a bit of situational value, but overall not much to talk about. Again, don't ever slam these items and waste their components.   All other spatula items: Little to no value, ever. Better off using single spat and component to trigger Cyber traits.  **Champions**  This section personifies why the whole thing works. There are certain champs that are in most/all of our late games, there are certain champs that are in most/all of our earlygames, there are certain champs that may be great champions that you just almost never see in our comps. A lot of this is gameflow and what you are offered, as well as making the strongest board possible, which is critical for all of these compositions.  This section is also subject to the compositions rule: Always take advantage of random highrolls. Always slam down super strong midgame boards, even if some of the  s won't age into your final comp. If you can end up with 2 * Xin and 2 * Rakan, and get an early Neeko, just run 4 protectors and use them as item holders for a couple of rounds. But again, know exactly why you're doing what you're doing if you   to do this.  3 sections for the champs:   Yes, aka always or almost always snag and jam into comp, or always check to see if you need them in your final comp.  Situational, aka only snag with purpose and almost never let sit on your bench.  No, aka almost never utilize.  I will add keywords or important details where important. I will only go through 1, 2, and 3 cost  s, maybe with small notes on some others. I will try to not comment too much on items or things discussed in the previous sections:  *1 Cost*  Graves: Yes, always look for strong space pirate additions, as well as being vital for 2 blaster  Poppy: Yes, two vanguard is insane right now, very good earlygame value  Leona: Yes, Vanguard and Cyber  Fiora: Yes, though almost no value without Cyber. Bordering situational  Malphite: Yes, though sometimes you can sell for econ if not 2 *. Be careful though, it feels really bad to not have 4 brawler trait because you can't find Malphite 1 *.  Xayah: Sometimes, good item holder, heavily contested  TF and Cait: Sometimes, Chrono triat, can be Kayle item holders  Ziggs: No  J4: No  Khazix: No  Zoe: No  *2 Cost*  Lucian: Yes, always, so important, red buff, midgame carry, item holder, sell for MF in B/B  Blitzcrank: Yes, highly contested, be careful releasing one, because some games you might not find it again for a while  Shen: Yes, highly contested, be careful releasing one, because some games you might not find it again for a while  Darius: Situational, very good often, but not a lategame transition hold, item holder, need Graves  Mordekaiser: Very Situational, vanguard, good item holder, especially defensive items and support items  KaiSa: No, though sometimes needed for Valkarie splash  Ahri: No  Rakan: No  Sona: No, mystic tech  Xin: No  Annie: No  Yasuo: No, though blademaster tech  *3 Cost*  Ezreal: Yes, always, highly contested, be careful releasing one, because some games you might not find it again for a while  Vi: Yes, highly contested, be careful releasing one, because some games you might not find it again for a while  Jayce: Yes, bordering situational, amazing item holder, vanguard, pirate, great   but no lategame  Kassadin: Situational, mana reaver is awesome, almost mandatory tech lategame in Kayle comp  Ashe: No, other than random situational sniper buff for Caitlyn item holder midgame  Karma: No, though buff means she is your 2 mystic tech champion in Kayle comps  Rumble: No  Shaco: No  Lux: No  Syndra: No  Yi: No  Neeko: No  *4 and 5 costs (Self-Explanatory in comps, though I will make some notes for non-intuitive cases. You're usually not splashing these champions in, so if they aren't in your lategame composition, you aren't going to purchase them.)*  Soraka: No, 2 or 4 mystic techable, usually not as good of a tech as Karma.  Wukong: Yes, sometimes splashable in comps he doesn't belong in. Very good placeholder midgame in Cybers and B/B, mandatory in Kayle comps.  Lulu: Your main mystic splash. Always ideal to get a celestial spat on one of the late carousels with this splash. Combo with Kassadin for 2 celestials as lategame tech.  GP: Usually only splashable with demolition spat at level 9 of Kayle comps. Demo spat on MF.  ASol: Level 9 tech in blaster/brawler that didn't get a rebel spat. I am a big fan of this, as it really is a pretty good naked   at level 2, and 9 without spat items doesn't do much for 4blaster/4brawler variant.  Thresh: Extremely important even though he isn't a carry in Cyber and Kayle comps.      **Conclusion**     There's a lot of info here about how I currently view the game and have my strategy constructed around. I hope that some people find it helpful. If you'd like a gameplay guide or galaxies guide or any additional information, I will make one if enough interest exists. Let me know if there are any questions, I will do my best to answer all questions.     Thank you!  Berm", "id": "gl0pe5", "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1589657251}, 
{"title": "[EUW GM] Detailed Guide to the New Variation of Kayle and Friends Comp", "author": "BlackJackVII", "selftext": "Hey guys, it's BlackJack here. I am currently a 480LP GM on EUW, peaked 10LP away from Challenger then lost 3 LP the next day, but let's not talk about that...   Recently I have been trying out different variations of Kayle comp, and found out what was the most successful one for me. The one that runs Irelia, Soraka. I am here to share with you guys my thoughts on how to play the not-entirely-new yet really consistent Kayle comp and hopefully we can come up with a cool name for it, instead of the name \"4-cost comp\". SO, let's get into it! This is my first time writing a guide, so please bear with me if i am repeating myself haha :p  **First Carousel Item Priority: Bow Gloves    Vest =Belt  anything else**  Usually I would just go for bow, as almost no one goes for it, it also builds into Rageblade and RFC for Kayle. Gloves is good due to its versatility, QSS, Trapclaw are all built from it, however it is always contested at the carousel, by those Xayah players (forcers)...   Belt and Vest are good for defensive items such as Frozen heart and Redemption, which are always overlooked, but these two items can help you win early rounds which you would have otherwise lost. However, we would rather these two components dropped from neutrals instead of having to pick them up from the first carousel.   I will be real here, if you got 0 bows after Krugs, it's probably better to play other comps and save yourself some of that hard-earned LP :D  **Early Game:**   It is not a surprise that early game is extremely important in the current meta. However, it is specifically important for this build, due to the fact that you   to get to level 9. Bleeding out early usually leads to more gold spent on rerolls at level 7 or 8. Therefore, you almost always   to level to 4 on 2-1 or 2-2 if you do not have enough gold. Pre-Level to 5 at 2-3 or level after the Carousel. I personally prefer Pre-levelling for that sweet 5% chance at getting your kayle. However, levelling after carousel is probably more consistent econ-wise. Do not hesitate to slap any defensive items onto your tanks, it's really important! My optimal early game board would look like  this:       If you get lucky and find an early Ashe, you almost always winstreak. Caitlyn is imo superior than Xayah due to her ult being magic damage, you actually can kill a poppy with vanguard buff lol. If not then running something like this is also fine:        I prefer running Vanguards than Brawlers, as Vanguards are tankier early and allow easier mid game transition into Jayce/Wukong.  **Mid Game:**   Mid game is imo the most straight forward part of playing this comp, just play the strongest board, econ and pick up upgrades such as Kassa, Jayce, Wukong and ofc Kayle. A Jayce 1 is better than Leona 2 if you also have Poppy 2 to be the main tank, otherwise keep the Leona 2 until Jayce 2 in later roll downs. Cait 2 is still a good carry here before you hit your Kayle. Swap out cait 2 asap if you get your Kayle, tbh I don't think Kayle 1 is that much better than a cait 2 with sniper buff, however you would hate have 4 gold sitting on the bench for too long. Here is what I would consider a good mid game board:        Aggressively level to 6 or 7 if you are winstreaking and add in new   that an provide your comp with something else, for example I would totally level to 7 at 3-5 or 3-6 if I have a Darius 2 available to me for the mana-reaver trait.   **Late Game:**   Here is the most interesting part of the game, as you will do the most thinking and limit testing. Let's assume we had a decent early to mid game. As we are trying to go fast 9, we are not going spend a lot of gold rolling unless we absolutely have to. As a result, we are most likely going to losestreak a bit in stage 4. Slow level to 8 with interest if we are healthy(above 70 health). Level to 9 after the Raptors and roll down to complete your comp. However, if we are bleeding out too much, for example below 50 health before 4-3. Then we should level to 8 there and roll to find a Kayle 2 or Jayce 2 plus Kasse 2 to stabilize. Keepp in mind do not Donkeyroll if you dont hit Kayle 2 after the rolldown, think about if you can sack one of two rounds until Raptors to save up some gold, then roll for Kayle 2 if necessary.   If everything goes well, at 6-1 we are level 9 with a board like this:       ***Here is my explanation to the comp:***   First of all, I prefer Shen over Thresh a lot because of how often we run into Xayah comps and Jinx comps. Shen can slow down these two team comps drastically, which allows your Kayle to stack up the Rageblade and do her thing. Also in order to make Thresh work, we would need a bench of a few good  s. Yet, I find that in most games if I am not too far ahead, I simply do not have the spare gold to get a bench for Thresh, since we will be prioritizing rolling for Kayle 2 and MF 2 and such.   Furthermore, Mystic is imo really under-used in late game comps, as we all know,  s such as MF and GP reign over late game fights, the difference is day and night if your team has Mystic buff to tank through the burst damage from those  s. You can opt to run Karma instead of Soraka if your Kayle has no Rageblade, Karma shield helps a ton.   Additionally, Vanguard is a nice addition, yet not entirely necessary. You can swap out the Jayce for a Blaster if you happen to have a red buff or GS. However, personally it always feels bad to sell a level 2 Jayce who can both tank and deal damage, a level 2 Jayce with Thief Claw has carried me through a lot late game fight. Vanguard armor bonus is also great vs carries that do not have a LW.   Last but no least, positioning is highly matchup dependent, however you   your carries with QSS or Trapclaw in the corner to tank the blitz hook so that the enemy Jinx won't get her first kill too easily, which is a deciding factor in a late game fight.       **BIS for Kayle: Rageblade, RFC plus either QSS or Trapclaw depending on the lobby**.   QSS is imo better in most cases, however if there's a mech player with demo kaisa, or to neglect the damage from the cait 3 ult in Xayah comp (as your kayle will mostly likely to in the furtherest corner), Trapclaw does wonders. GA has been a bit underwhelming, since if the enemy team can get to Kayle and kill her the first time, they almost always can do it a second time. But GA is good vs Irelia as it resets the aggro and denies Irelia a reset. Nevertheless, a well-placed Shen can hold the enemy Irelia back just fine for your Kayle to do the killing.       I know there are still a lot areas that I can cover, but every game is different than the previous one, thus it would only make this post even longer than it already is(sorryyyy about that    ). But feel free to ask me in the comments if you have any questions.   Hopefully, you guys can learn a thing or two from this :) Cheers!", "id": "gkoacu", "num_comments": 78, "created_utc": 1589602144}, 
{"title": "[MASTER] In-Depth Kobe Ziggs/Bomberman Guide (3* Ziggs)", "author": "Soveric", "selftext": "Background:  Disclaimer: this is my first guide. I was hardstuck Diamond for the last two patches, going back and forth from D1 and D4. After seeing a post on here about the potential of this comp I decided to try it. Turns out, the comp is pretty busted and fun. I ran it and climbed to Masters from D2 pretty quickly. It's advantage over Xayah comps is that rather than needing to 3 * three/four  s to do well (Xayah, J4, Caitlyn, Fiora), this comp can win early/mid game easily with just a 3 * Ziggs and optionally Malphite. This leaves you with a lot more gold to level. It also has a higher cap since it's end game uses MF and GP.      FINAL COMP:        Item Priority: Tear -  Rod -  Vest -  Sword  Full Item Priority: 2x Seraph -  Rabadon = GA -  Demo Spat  Running this requires at least one Seraph's on Ziggs but two is ideal on him with a decent rod item (Rabadon's, Luden's,  Bejeweled)      Early Game: (DO NOT LEVEL)  1. Aim for Tear on opening carousel 2. Get at least 10 gold by 1st Carousel to econ while picking up Ziggs/Malphites.    1. A good econ-friendly early game board is Ziggs/Malphite/Blitz + TF/Caitlyn for Chrono/Brawler 3. Optional to int for tears, not recommended unless highly contested 4. By Krugs, aim to have 40-50g 5. After Krugs, at Level 4 8/10 exp, roll down and pick up Rebels, prioritizing Ziggs and Malphite      Mid Game:  1. Build Econ back up to 50g    1. If you have 3 * Ziggs, slow level to 8. You can go to 9 if you're winstreaking and are relatively healthy.    2. If you didn't hit, slow roll until you do 2. Pick up Rebels on the way to level 8/9    1. If you get low, you can stop force a level up to 8 with 20-30g to roll down for 5 * 3. You can throw in Brawlers to frontline for Ziggs, Rumble for Demolitionist, or Shen for frontline/chrono with 3-5 Rebels. Ziggs will be dealing massive damage at this point, nearly one shotting everyone he ults, so frontline works well here.      Late Game: (Preferably level 8/9 with 50g)  1. Roll down for Gangplank and Miss Fortune. 2. Get upgrades 3. If you hit 9, throw in Kayle for Valkyrie or Lulu for Mystic      Items Discussion:  Personally, I feel like this comp requires double Seraph's to get a top 2 unless you get highroll items on 2 * Gangplank/MF. For the third item, Luden's is pretty overlooked, but it works well in getting splash damage so you're ult on them can one shot later. There's a lot of situations where no-rod item 3 * Ziggs leaves them at  ~10%. Rabadon is ideal and bejeweled is decent as well.  If you get stuck with other items, tank items can be put onto GP or used for Red Buffs for Jinx. Bows and swords can also be used by Jinx as well. GP and GA are, as usual, very important to go together. Rabadon's on 2 * can hard win a lot of late game fights.  Aurelion Sol adds to the cap of this comp, as giving him a demo-spat makes the team near invulnerable. Constant CC while GP AOE clears and Ziggs takes out the tanky individuals. Demo spat on him isn't going to happen too often, but I'd argue it's better than a FoN if you already have full Ziggs items.", "id": "gjw3ek", "num_comments": 52, "created_utc": 1589493604}, 
{"title": "The Great Lakes Mana Printer Only Challenger Guide", "author": "dennisj9", "selftext": "Hi All,   It's [The Great Lakes]  your favorite 1-tricking Challenger assistant principal. In my last guide I wrote about how I played [only   Guardians from Diamond to Challenger.]  In this guide, I will explain how I climbed to Challenger from Master 0LP by gaining [820 LP in 4 days]  forcing my version of mana printer every game.    ;  **Gather around boys and girls and listen to my tale.**     ;  When patch 10.9 launched I dropped from Challenger to Master 0 LP. I don't smurf, so I do all of my experimentation on my main and on the ladder. I thought I could figure out a way to keep 6   Guardians viable, but alas it was not the case. There were too many nerfs to Syndra, SG trait, and 3- ring the 3-cost  s to keep the comp viable. As a result, we  t this journey at 0LP.    ;  **Other Comp Attempts:**  * **Battery Void Brawlers:** This comp interested me, but I wasn't seeing a huge payoff for investing in the Void trait and Brawlers were getting hyper contested by Blaster Brawlers. The Sona - Velkoz synergy caught my attention though.  * **Candyland:** I found out that I was not cut out for the Candyland life.  * **2 Vanguard - 6 Sorc:** I could get on board with this build, but the build was too volatile for my liking.    ;  **Final Comp - The Great Lakes Mana Printer:**  I ended up combining Battery Void Brawlers with the Vang/Sorc comp and splashing in Mystic.  * [Typical Build at Level 8]   * [If you 3-  your Poppy]   * [If you are on a FoN Galaxy]   **Outcome:** I found out that the damage output is still amazing even without the void or 6-sorc trait, but the insane survivability of having both Sona and Soraka healing on top of the Mystic trait and a decently strong frontline allowed for me to outlast opponents in almost all cases.    ;   **Comments and Explanation:**    ;  #1. What Do You Do If You Do Not Hit Perfect Items on Sona?: You will not hit perfect items on Sona for most games. That's alright. When it comes to carousel and first priority items, go for two chalices first no matter what. Even if it means you are taking a negatron cloak on the carousel because you have an unused tear. You will be dead in the water without the two chalices, but you can still win games without seraphs. You'll notice many of my games Sona has two or three chalices with no seraphs.   #2. Item Holders: For this comp, I will have Poppy and TF hold items. If you hit an early Morellos, throw that bad boy on TF. GA components? Throw them on Poppy. These two  s will help you get through early and mid game while adding to the SG and Sorc traits. Make sure you are only putting GA's/Thornmails or other defensive items on Poppy. If you naturally hit Poppy 3, she is worth keeping in even though she's an item holder.  [This is what a typical level 6 looks like for me.]   #3. Why Not TF for Chrono?: When I first  ted playing this build, I was using TF over Lux for the Chrono trait with consistent success still. However, after a suggestion from CXLIX CXLIX, I decided to replace TF with Lux and the build really took off. Lux benefitting from a mana printer changed the trajectory of games with whole team stuns and backline snipes. Champions are casting more than auto attacking, so the loss of Chrono wasn't felt.  #4. Why Not 6 sorcs?: As stated earlier, the benefits from Mystic and having Soraka next to a mana battery has clear upsides that outshine the 6-sorc trait. Most games my frontline doesn't even die after the build comes online due to outhealing the opposition and the extreme value that 2-vanguard give.  #5. Leveling and Rolling: I level to 7 at wolves and try not to roll at all before then. After hitting level 7, I'll roll down to 20-30 gold stabilize and put together a team that can carry me to Raptors at least. Once I have the gold to hit level 8 with 20 gold extra, I'll level. Sometimes this is immediately following the round 4 carousel, other times it is after raptors.  #6. HP Goals: I set a goal for myself to be at least 80HP by Krugs and at least 60HP by Wolves. If you can pull this off, you've had a successful early and mid game. Try to only roll before level 7 when you feel as though you are not on a trajectory to hit these goals.  #7. What Do You Do With a Spat?: Pray for another one, brother. However, if that 2nd spat doesn't come SG trait on Vel'koz is never bad and if you only hit 2 chalice on Sona with no complete seraph's, an SG spat on her isn't a bad consolation prize at all.  #8. Who Do You 3- ?: * **1-Costs:** I only 3-  Poppy and Zoe if it happens naturally. * **2-Costs:** I will save Ahri and Sona and try to 3-  them as I roll down at level 7 and 8. * **3-Costs:** I don't 3-  Lux, but you will see an immense power spike if you 3-  Jayce. He benefits from mana printer and 4 sorc allowing his to wipe teams. In most games, he is my #1 damage dealer once 3- red. * **4-Cost:** 3- red Vel'Koz is an obvious win condition. However, 3- red Wukong is an underappreciated win condition. Have you ever read his description? It's a 5 second stun that does a ton of damage. If Wukongs  t showing up in my store, I'll entertain the idea and save them until I am desperate on cash.  #9. Other Good Items: The build revolves around 2 chalices, a seraphs, and hopefully a morellos. However, there are many other items that perform very well in the comp.  * QSS on Vel'koz is game changing * GA is as good as ever on a frontline * Bramble and Frozen Heart are high performers * I'm never going to turn down a death cap or Jeweled Gauntlet on Vel'koz either * Theif's gloves on Ahri have given me the edge in a lot of games. * My advice is to avoid bows and BF swords as much as you can.  #10. Counters: Watch out for Shrouds and well placed Zephyrs. Your build relies on positioning that is essentially predictable. If someone has a Shroud, they have to move 1   to have a high impact on your entire team while you need to move at least 6  s to dodge it as the comp relies on close proximity to Sona. This gives the opponent a huge advantage, especially if your Sona does not have perfect items.  Zephyr functions in a similar way. It's easy to predict where your Sona will be and if you move her too much to dodge the zephyr, then she has a diminished impact for your team.    ;  I'll be around to answer questions if you have them.    ;  -The Great Lakes aka Leona Gone Wild", "id": "gglkem", "num_comments": 103, "created_utc": 1589051457}, 
{"title": "An in-depth updated guide to Brainless Candyland Guide", "author": "daydreamin511", "selftext": "   I'm Layzz on NA and I'm a **shameless Candyland spammer**. Having played flex the entire set, I dropped down from Masters to Diamond 2 this patch and decided that if you can't beat them.. then join them. If you simply   to climb and   to forgo learning the nuances of the game, this is the composition for you.  There are numerous guides on this composition but after reading the initial guide on it, the meta since then has evolved to mitigate the dominance of this comp. I consider this comp to be a top-four lock and force able, therefore brainless. However, many players easily bottom four despite hitting  s and simply fall behind due to tunnel visioning and lack of game flow awareness. In this guide, I will include minor optimization from the original iteration and showing you the mindset you need to consistently place high with this comp. Collect ELO now before it gets nerfed.  # Early game  **Mindset and rule:** Hit at least 10 gold before the first carousel.   You can't compromise this rule. You guild this comp from the very carousel. That means you're forcing and you're not pivoting. You can't treat this like a flex comp. You turn off your brain and collect elo. Early game is arguably the most vital part of this composition. The priority items are:   1. Chain Vest 2. Negatron Cloak 3. Rod  Ideally, you   to play the strongest board possible to save HP while maintaining econ. You can get creative here. In the first two rounds you can play random two-   s. **But**. Whatever you do, *always* end the first round 2 with 10 gold. That means selling that Malph2 for three gold to hit 10 gold. You can forgo the strongest board rule by 2-3 and have a four level 1  s on the board as long as you hit 10 gold. You saved HP the first two rounds and that's enough to make a difference.   What happens when you don't hit any  s? Don't panic. If you have at least one  , you're still in the game because your power spike is coming soon.   What happens when you get gold  t? It's perfect. You can hit 20 gold in rare cases before the second carousel and you get pick priority.   Slammable items: Bramble and Ionic Spark.   Ideal early game board:     # Pre-Krugs  **Mindset and rule:** Econ  At this point, you   to prioritize hitting the threshold. You can afford to tank these next two rounds as long as you have candyland components. Don't expect to win fights but don't expect to lose hard either. TF - Zoe - Leona - Poppy is a decent early game core. It has a good front line, CC, and AoE and can even win some fights if you high rolled a two-   .   # Krugs  Mindset and rule: Collect Poppy, Zoe, TF, and *at least* one Ahri or Syndra.  The amount of gold you get at this stage will vary but if you've played the early game correctly, you will have at least 30 gold. The optimization I made from the original one is forgoing the Leona 3. However, there are rare instances where you find 3 Leona's in one shop, don't hesitate to slam purchase but ideally, she's not important in the grand scheme of things.   Roll down to zero unless you high rolled the fuck out of your team and already have three-  Poppy and TF/Zoe with like ten gold left. In that case, stay at 10 gold. However, in most games, you will roll down to zero.   What happens if you don't hit any three  s? Don't panic yet unless you got royally unlucky - I'm talking about getting three Poppys, 3 TFs, 2 Zoes type of unlucky during the initial roll down. Statistically speaking though, the availability should give you plenty of  s and I've only had one game where I low rolled Poppy and still managed to finish 5th.  The ideal board:    # Poppy Items   I think this is a good segment to talk about Poppy items. I've seen people debate the ideal Poppy items but having experienced the ebbs and flows of the meta, the tweak I'm making from the original iteration is removing Death Cap. It's fun and hilarious to see her stack HP with Death Cap but the reality of the situation doesn't match the theory. Slamming that item is a one-way ticket to bottom 6. Her role in this team is to hold down the front line for your squishy back-line and late-game damage is way too strong for her to make this a reality. The priority items are:  1. Bramble Vest 2. Dragon Claw 3. Warmog / Ionic Spark / Frozen Heart   Bramble Vest allows you to compete with IE-centric comps. The diversity of this item is what you allow you to check a majority of the comps and is considered a mid-game monster. The difficulty with this item is that chain vest is hotly contested and you won't always get it.   Dragon Claw is what Bramble Vest's value is in the late game. This item allows you to compete with the fab 5, the magic damage monsters in the late game: Jynx, Kayle, Vel, 3 * Darius, and MF. Poppy holds down the fort against them while your back-line deals damage. This is how the flow of the fight usually goes against the former three. She will soak a lot with this item. In most cases, this item is what makes or breaks a top 4 placement.   The third item slot is versatile. Warmog is my favorite late-game item. It makes her even more of a meat shield late game where damage is king and survivability is most important for your back-line to do damage. However, there are instances where you slam Ionic Spark early game if you get a double cloak + rod  ts. It's a substitute for low rolling chain vest. Ionic will carry you through the early-mid game. Frozen Heart is pretty sweet against AD heavy lobbies.  # Mid Game  Mindset and rule: Econ to 40-50, pick up sorcs without compromising econ. High-rolled Wukong1   Leona 2.  This is the phase of the game considered brainless. You can probably AFK at this point because you're considered extremely stable. Even with a two-  board, Poppy items should save you from losing a ton of HP. The ideal scenario is at least one   and build a streak from here.  This rule is important because it is a build-up for your late game composition. Your stable point has an expiry time. If you get greedy and roll once, you will lose the game. No matter how tempting it is to hit three  s while you have 8 Poppy's on your bench, just sit on it. There are 39 Poppy's in the game and you will eventually get it.   Lastly, I've mounted a large win streak by following this rule: if your TF is three- red, slam an item that Poppy won't need later. It can be HOJ, Morello, GA, Shiv. There's simply nothing in the mid-game that can stop this team barring opposing Candy or high-rolled items Shredder.  # Stage 4 (Post-Wolves)  Mindset: Level to 6 if you have 3 * Poppy and TF. Greed one round and push your luck.  This is around the time you should be at 40-50 gold depending on your drops. You can opt to greed and roll a bit to complete your three  s for one round depending on your health and strength of the lobby. But understand that, this is a huge power spike for the lobby and you're no longer extremely stable. Ideally, you should've hit Poppy and TF by now. Getting four sorcs in is more important to keep up with the flow of the game. Four sorcs are a huge power spike and in most cases, allows you to be stable yet again during stage 4.   Ideal positioning vs mid-game Cho, Irelia, Void, and Shredders     # Late game  Mindset: Assess the lobby and craft your late-game comp   This is where the comp  ts to fall off a bit. Sure you can copy and paste 6 sorcs in most cases if you're too lazy to scout but if you   to consistently place top 4 then this is part of the game where you have to hone your creativity and be flexible.   A bulk of the creativity will be a combination of the items dropped during the last minion phase and scouting the strongest players in the lobby. I'll list four variants depending on the lobby and items dropped.   # Standard 6 Sorc     Good standard and the ideal composition you   level 8 vs tighter lobbies. It's good into most lobbies where the strongest players aren't evident yet. Slam a Zzrot if you get components on Wukong acting as a third front line. Get creative with your item drops. You   to prioritize TF or Vel depending on the situation.   # High Roll Tear or Treasure Trove     Rare version of this comp if you high rolled tears or you're playing on a treasure trove galaxy. Forgoing 6 sorcs for 4 sorcs in this situation is viable because your sorcs are casting so much and the endless CC from Zoe 3 + Lux makes this comp unbearable to play. This is probably the top 1 variant of this comp but relies heavily on RNG. Good vs. magic damage heavy teams.   # Niche Protector SG     In rare cases, you have opport ies to build Protector variant and you have one item slot left on Poppy. This is the e-girls comp with a stacked Poppy. It's good against Cybers and Space Jam. Neeko CC is very good against melee teams and Poppy is almost always the last person standing with this build.   # Level 9 builds   Level 9 is a situation that happens sometimes depending on how well you did in the mid-game and depending on the galaxy played on. These are variants of the comp that aims to compete for a top 1-2 finish.  Burst (8 Sorcs)     Good vs. opposing Candy Players and Void Printer.   # The Plank     Gangplank is one of the  s I keep an eye on in the late game. His ult is game-changing and can turn mismatches into a winnable fight thanks to his ult. You   GA ideally on him so he can cast once. Upgraded GP pushes this team to a top 1-2 finish. Grab a demo spat if possible. In some games, I will save neekos (Neekoverse) for GP but the early-late game has to be immaculate to save neekos for GP late game. If that happens, I forgo Wukong and go for GP 2 * late game if I'm still level 8.   # Final notes  1. Is Zoe 3 * worth it? Yes. It's my favorite   on this team. It's one of the least contested 1 cost in the game and if you manage to high roll her in the initial roll down, then you will likely streak. 4-second stun is incredibly strong CC in all stages of the game. 2. How do you counter stacked 2 * MF? It's one of the few that can wipe the floor of this team especially if she has upgrades. Grab a shroud of stillness at the carousel and delay her cast. It's even better if she doesn't have tears because she will take an eternity to cast and if the fight plays out correctly, she will ult way too late and she'll be up against Poppy 1v1 and she doesn't stand a chance if she has Dragon Claw.  3. How do you beat void printer? You don't. Printer comps are the bane of this team. Just pray they low roll or use one of the recommended teams vs. magic dealers above to compete with them but in most cases, you lose this match up convincingly. Trap Claw, Morello, and QSS help a bit but it's a matchup that's difficult no matter how you slice it. 4. Is Wukong 1 better than Leona 2? In almost any case, yes. CC is king. Wukong is an especially good mid-game pick up if you high roll him at level 5. The damage isn't high yet in the mid-game so he can cast once and provide that juicy knock up.  5. Does Shredder beat this team? I find from my experience that Shredder comps need to high roll items. Glove is one of the more contested items and Xayah is useless without QSS. A high rolled shredder comp will beat this team though, but it won't be in a stompy fashion like void printer does.  6. How do you beat Poppy? Last Whisper and she falls off late game against well-itemized teams. CC and mana reaver ruin her day as well. When Poppy dies and you don't have ZZrot, you will get 20-0'd pretty quickly which is why I advocate full tank Poppy over Death Cap variants.", "id": "ggi726", "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": 1589040892}, 
{"title": "A different way to build Void Brawlers (Attack Speed Printer Khazix goes BRRRRRR)", "author": "PsyDM", "selftext": "     I got tired of playing meta comps and really missed the old Void Brawler build. I really, really hate Mana Printer Sona, and it's made tears so contested that they can't be reliably gotten from carousels. So this got me thinking... you know what else works a lot like mana? Lots and LOTS of attack speed! So I hopped on my mid/high Diamond alt and began to experiment. After 9 games of forcing the comp I got top 4 8 times before I'd actually finalized the build. Feedback is appreciated as I'm still working out the kinks!  **THE DREAM**   Get as many Zeke's Heralds as possible. Sword is the best  t since everyone  s gloves/tear/bow/chain vest in this meta and belt is mostly only contested by Blasters. This combined with the ~~trash items carousel~~  Super Happy Funtime carousel coming with completely ignored Zekes makes this really easy to stack every game. The build has anywhere from 2 to 4 carries (Velkoz/Fizz/Khazix/TF 3) and combined with a beefy frontline makes this team a legit threat.  EARLY GAME:     Slam early Heralds on Khazix 2 or whatever other carrier makes sense (Xayah 2/Caitlyn 2). Bramble goes on Malphite. All Velkoz items go on a holder   - Kaisa is best for 2 infiltrator but Ahri is also good.  MID GAME:  Play the best board you can at all times and prioritize leveling. DO NOT HYPERROLL. Khazix/TF/Malphite 3 are nice bonuses but are not required to top 4 Velkoz/Cho are pretty contested in mana printer/blaster comps. Having all of your purple  s stolen from you is a certain loss. Transfer items from your carrier to velkoz the moment you get them, velkoz 1 just with sorc buff is still a monster. Position him carefully though because he's made of paper. If you can transfer items to a different temporary sorc then replacing Kaisa with Fizz 1 is also worth it, him getting his ult off on the backline is INSANE, it makes me sad that he only gets played in mech builds :(  LATE GAME:     Assembling this comp after a healthy early/mid game should guarantee a top 4. We compress our team to the back so that the whole enemy team moves forward and leaves their carries vulnerable to infiltrators. Your best item for bows is RFC - with all the attack speed stacking Velkoz won't actually need tears. This frees up tears for Frozen Heart or Hoj which are perfect for Fizz/Khazix. Win condition is Khazix 3 with a bunch of heralds, great items on Velkoz and hitting Fizz 3. Fizz is by far the least contested 4 cost for you to hit in this meta and you're liable to force mech infil players to bottom 4 by stealing their fizzes. If you hit him then frontline him so his ult goes off immediately. Spat is pretty hard to work in but Infiltrator Khazix should be decent - if you can make demo spat really early then pivoting to Mech Infils is likely the best play.", "id": "gg1lze", "num_comments": 103, "created_utc": 1588971761}, 
{"title": "(GM 1) Guide To Brawler Blasters (long)", "author": "autosong18", "selftext": "Hi I'm TFT Requiem, Former C1 in Garena and currently Gm and climbing in Na. This is my first guide so my writing might be bad :(  There's a summary at the bottom if you do not have time.          I just  ed to give a guide on Brawler Blaster, my favourite comp since patch 10.8b. I know everyone's been complaining about the state of the game due to all the 1 cost hyperrolls (Shredder, Candyland, Void Kha) but I've been consistently climbing even without playing these hyperroll comps.     Your first priority from the carousel is vest, as it could be made into bramble, GA, red buff, shroud and Frozen heart which are really good in this meta. If you lose the carousel fight, your 2nd priority is Glove or Bow for LW which I believe is the best item right now due to poppy players and 2 vanguard players early game. If you lose everything, just go after what is left, except rod as it is useless.  After the creep rounds you need to always look for the strongest  s there are to save hp and scout if there are other players who would be potentially stronger than you even if you level to 4. I usually level to 4 at 2-1 if i get a red buff. Your potential 2-1 board would look like this:     Lucian with red buff + leftover items to your other cyber  s. However, if you aren't lucky enough to get a cyber  t or a lucian you can manage your board with any champs you 2   and put ur items on a early carry. E.g. Xayah 2, Cait 2, Tf 2, Kha 2 and so on.   You should try to get a 2nd full item from the carousel, to finish your 2nd jinx item (LW, Trap Claw, GA) or a item you can utilise like Ionic Spark, Zephyr, TG, Bramble, ZZrot and Frozen heart.   * * * If you have a tear always try to build redemption  * * * Redemption on Cho can save lives.   After the carousel, at 2-5 you should level up and put in a extra 2   or a good synergy. Malph 2, Blitz or Graves 2 can suffice. If you get a vi at any stage replace Fiora with Vi and give the extra item you gave on Fiora to Lucian.          If you winstreaked all the way to the 2nd Creeps, I usually level to 6 at 3-1 and roll down, look for a lucky jinx or brawlers to put in. If you do not winstreak, level to 6 at 3-2 and roll down to 0. I've never seen people in even GM and Chall roll down to 0, which made my board stronger and allowed me to winstreak and save my hp.  Your potential 3-2  board would look like this, with a jinx or a jinx pair on the bench:     After rolling down, you should econ back up till 4-1 no matter how much you lose or win. (Best Jinx items are LW GS GA with redbuff on Ezreal) Just pick up potential final  s and at 4-1, level up to 7 then roll again to 0. This should give you a Jinx 2 or a Cho 2 with upgrading other brawler  s to 2 s as well. Pick up Sona and Karma during this rolldown as they can potentially buildup in to 4 Brawlers 3 rebels 2 blasters 2 chrono if Mf doesnt appear. Throw away your lucian after you get a Jinx 2   *Never try to 3  anything early except maybe Vi.   *DO NOT GO FOR MF ITEMS there's no certain that you'd hit a mf or a mf 2 at 8, which would be your final board.  After your 4-1 rolldown, your board should consist of:        If there is a Kassadin or Rakan that can immobilize your jinx, you can change the board to your right or to:         You should seek to level up to 8 at 4-5 or 5-1 depending on your hp and gold. If you do not get your Jinx/Cho/Vi after your 4-1 roll, you need to roll for at least a Jinx 2 before levelling up. There's a lot of difference between Jinx 1 and Jinx 2. After reaching 8, roll down again for a potential MF or MF 2 or to 2  anything you have left over. If you find a MF, you have to give her your left over items or items made with rods and tears and go typical 4B B.         If you do not find Mf, however, You need to find a Karma/Lulu and finish your board like this:     After your board is finished, you have 2 options: Level to 9 and find an asol or roll at 8, looking for MF 2 and for Jinx 3/Cho 3. As I play in a higher elo lobby, people have strong boards and I usually do not get to do either and just finish with the board i showed above.      Summary:  2-1 level 4 strongest board  2-5 level 5 strongest board  3-2 level 6 roll to 0 strongest board  4-1 level 7 roll to 0 strongest board  5-1 level 8 roll to 0 strongest board  Scout frequently to see if there are other jinx users and if there are more than 2 take these 1 stage ahead to take the  s first.  If you dont get brawler  s or jinxes and if you get a lot of irelias and kayles on the 3-2 roll or 4-1 roll you can go for chrono kayle or cybers, making this playstyle a lot more flexible.      Thank you for reading my guide! Hope you guys can climb fast after reading this guide. Feel free to ask questions or point out any mistakes on this post or add me in game.

The essence of this comp is that at level 6, you have Chrono/BM and some mix of minor synergies. Generally this is cybers or celestial, but Chrono/Pirates/Vanguard/Blasters have all worked in my experience. From that point you can springboard into Cybernetiks, Chrono Kayle or a loose variation of Chrono Kayle with Irelia carry, depending on the board state and your items. Since the Irelia carry comp is the one I have least often seen discussed as a comp, it will be the focus of this post.   Once you get to lvl 6 between 3-3 and 3-7, your board could look something like this        Once you get to this point you should have a good idea of what items you have. Lots of BF swords generally indicate an Irelia carry comp or Cybers, or you can go Chrono Kayle if you get 2 items for her. You can also choose a carry based on the first 4 cost you get. At lvl 7, you should have your carry on the board with at least 2 items, that's when this comp spikes hardest.   My ideal Irelia common comp at lvl 7 looks like this:     From here, I can put it Lucian, Kayle, or 4 chrono, with my two ideal late game comps looking like this:        You can switch out Brawlers with Vanguard, or easily duck back into 6 cybers. I almost never run 6 cybers, because the small synergies make Irelia a huge power house.  Finally, I pick up Zephyrs and BM spats, if I can. The best comp with a BM spat is 2 celestial 6 BM at lvl 9 with Kayle, Xayah, shen, Fiora, and BM Lucian for the extra red buff procs.", "id": "gdkly4", "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1588627807},

I will answer my best any questions :)        **COMP / PLACEMENT :**         Ideal Comp :                 This is the **ideal** comp at level 8. Brawler frontline, Sona near Velkoz, Tf, Blitz. You can also swap Malph and Cho, for Cho to ult more either, but i'm gonna talk about that later. Kha sides for catch a carry isolate.          Transition comp :                Your level 5 should look like this. Ziggs is a good item holder, givin' Rebels buff for rushing 8 easily.        ** S :**    Vel'koz : The main source of damages in ur comp. Void destroy any frontlaners by true damages. Any compositions get destroyed in 1-2 ultimates. Dont prioritize Velkoz's items over Sona, but put any AP item you get. Morellos is the best by far for healing reduction and dot. DC, JQ do the job too. Build him atleast 1 defensive item, QSS = Trap   GA.     Sona : MVP. Call her Air Sona.      Sona ( and her items ) is the winning condition of your games. 3 CoF is a legend, wreck everything on the way, transform Velkoz into a laser machine-gun, TF into Gambit, Blitz into Madlife with 99% CDR, and sometimes Cho into the Chobot you can find in Doom Bots ( #weremember #ritogames ), and herself into a healing/cleasing machine.   Seraph is also a good item. Try to get atleast 2 CoF, keep every Tear/Cloak you get until.     TF : Give Chrono and Sorcerer for everyone, always a plus. Can do surprising damages sometimes.     Blitz : Brawler, Chrono, a hook. *What else?* ( Facts :  Zephyr is really fun on him )     Malphite : A very good tank at 2 * in early - mid game. Lose a little of interest in late game if not 3 *.     Cho'gath : Really good tank, tons of hp, tons of control. Sometimes, he ults one  , and you gonna blame him for your lose. Dont. Just dont, he needs ur trust.     Vi : Tank with control again. Add her level 8.     Kha : The leftover items holder. Place him on side to kill isolate carry. Blitz's hook can help you to get Khazix in this situation.     **FIRST CAROUSEL :**     TEAR   CLOAK   ROD   ANYTHING.     Always try to get the tear. Cloak is fine too. Rod's item can be useful on Ziggs in early game.     Keep Belt for Morello / Trap.  Keep Vest for GA/Rebel Spat ( gonna give a talk about that later in the possible alternative comp / level 9 comp )     Bow is kind of shit. I tried Guinsoo on Vel'koz, could be good with 2 Chrono. Maybe TR on Cho, idk.     Glove do QSS - Trap, even TG on Kha - Vi can do the job.     **ITEMS** : ( in order of importance )     CoF : Give Sona and 2 hexes  s 10 mana for each CoF you have. 3  * 10 = 30 mana every times Sona ults.      QSS = Trap   GA for Velkoz.     Morellos - Rod item for Velkoz.     Anything tank goes on Cho ( like GA, Ionic ) , dps on Kha ( RFC, IE, TG ).     Zephyr on Blitz is incredibly fun sometimes. Can win a round by himself.     **STATEGIES :**      RUSH 8.     Priotize Econ over  s. You're early games  s are cheap ( Malph, Ziggs, Sona, Blitz, TF ), so you can interests hard.  If you win ur first match, and   to winstreak, you can level at 2-4. If you cant reach 10 gold before carousel, and if leveled before, pre-lvl at 2-5 for reachin' lvl 5 after second carousel. That's mean you have earlier a chance to hit Velkoz/Cho when eco'ing. Not a fan of this, but doable.  Sona have 40 manapool. With atleast 3 tears ( 3 CoF, 1 CoF- 1 Seraph, 2 CoF - Shojin etc. ), she ults instantly at beginning of the fights, givin' a lot of mana around her. She is really ur win condition, with Velkoz/Cho 3 *.   Everytimes she ults, mana is floating around, making every  s around her *better* !     With Velkoz dealing massive true damages, he pop-offs every fights when Sona can feed him.     The Brawlers are here for tank control. Good s * *t.     Never build Kha over Sona/Velkoz/Cho. NEVER.      You HAVE to 3 * Velkoz/Cho/Sona if you   to top1.        **STAGES :**     EARLY GAME ( Lvl 3-5 ) :             Rebels   Brawlers   Chrono.

{"title": "AP Malphite Guide 10.9", "author": "Agusto_0", "selftext": "Hey there, I'm Agusto, currently Plat 2 so take this with a grain of salt. And any feedback would be great.  I enjoy theory crafting (almost more than playing) so I  ed to figure out a way to make the 8 sorc trait viable in a competitive setting.       Why AP Malphite?  The only reason you are sticking around is to answer this question, so I'll answer it first thing. The goal is 3 * Malphite. And it wouldn't be AP Malphite without sticking a deathcap on him haha, so the final build for him would usually be: Deathcap, Bramble Vest, Ionic Spark. The best way to explain this, is to show some numbers.        Base: 1 % spell power  Sorc 8: 120% spell power  Deathcap: 40% spell power  Ionic Spark: 20% spell power  Deathcap: +50%  *bonus * spell power  1  + (180+(180 *.5) = 370% spell power   Malphite ability: \"Malphite  ts combat with a shield equal to a percent of his maximum health\"  Malphite 3 * stats: HP - 2268 | Ability: 60% max health  370% spell power + 60% max health = 222% max health shield = 5,035 hp shield  This gives Malphite an effective  ting HP of: 7,303 hp      That plus his resistances makes him by far the single most tanky    in existence (that fits into a viable competitive comp). Making him the perfect solo front liner.  I'll show some comparisons to things like Mech at the bottom for those of you that really like numbers. For the rest of you, I'll get on with the guide.       In general, the weakness of the 8 sorc comp is not having a front line. The strength, is massive ap and damage... The fix, is AP Malphite. He is the only champ that gets tankier with AP,  (leo sorta too, but not really) this actually uses the AP bonus to make him an unkillable front line, tankier than even a mech. However, there are a few problems with this comp, mostly that it is very restrictive champ wise and doesn't come fully online until lvl 9.      One key thing to note, is leveling at the right time is very important for this comp, it spikes at odd levels 3,5,7,9, and also has a pretty balanced curve (slight early lean) champ wise 3 (1g), 2 (2g), 2 (3g), 1 (4g), 1 (5g)... So, if you are  ing to hyper role, its doable, even more so with the roll % changes. u can sit on lvl 4 / lvl 5, and go for 3 * or u can fast 7 / fast 9.  Depends on how much damage you are taking and what other comps are running.        Win con: 3 * Malphite with full items (one of which being a deathcap) That's pretty much all that is core to the comp.  Ideally this is run in a lobby without any other sorc comps, or just one SG comp, so 3  ing some sorcs should be expected. You can win at lvl 7 since 6 sorc is still strong too, but hitting 9 should be the goal for a top 1 finish.       Early Game:  Staying low level is good for you early on. just conserve your gold, pick up as many malphites and sorcs as possible.  For early stabilization, you can go 2 brawler, or cait tf for chrono.      Mid Game:  You can sit on lvl 5 and go for 3 *'s or push lvl 7, the 6 sorc bonus gives you alot of power when they have time to get the damage out. Both can be effective at keeping you healthy.  If you are already winning most match-ups saving your gold is ideal, as lvl 9 is still the dream.      End Game:  The hope is to hit 9, if you can't do that, its better to just roll down at lvl 7. Side note, if u never hit 3 * Malphite, u can go 8 and put in a second brawler.                  Keep in mind the most important thing is that Malphite doesn't die.  So itemization should be focused on finishing him as soon as possible.  Also, you   to keep every   you are buying, so you can't really have a   holding items for later, meaning putting some items on non carries will tend to happen, that's fine! Just make sure tankier items for the \"frontline\" and try and put items on interior sorcs so they dont get pulled or anything.               For this link these are just general options and to try and show that even items that don't normally work for sorcs can be slotted in. I'm by no means saying GS Xerath is the right move! Just showing some options for if Kayn gives you ad items or you are stuck with components that don't make anything good. In a perfect world you would get many tears and rods and build proper items!      Also, something to note, I generally use bramble, as I am the one hording sorcs, I tend to be vs more ad comps, thus the bramble gets extra value. As always, defensive itemization is lobby dependent. And positioning wise, I tend to put annie on strong side, as she is more durable than tf even without items.      Comparisons to other front lines:  Mech -   lvl 9 mech (all 3 * pilots) has a base health of: 4,853 hp  3 warmogs: 12  hp + pilot bonus (12  *.45) 540 = 1,740 hp (from items)  Grand Total HP: 6,593  So, even with as much hp from items as possible, AP Malphite still has 710  *more * HP than a fully stacked mech. Not counting the added resistances from bramble. Note, if you build bramble on the mech the hp gap is larger even if the armor is closer, so either way, Malphite ends up being strictly tankier than a fully stacked mech.    2 Brawler -   Reduction to 6 sorc (-45% spell power) + 350hp from brawler = Maphite's new health: 7,370 HP  Plus, second brawler (2 * Cho for this example) = 2,150hp  Basically, Malphite stays the same, but in addition u get another 2k hp from the Cho, at the cost of 45% spell power on all of your sorcs. Note, The point of the build is that Malphite is tanky enough on his own, which is why I only recomend this if you failed to 3 * Malphite before hitting mid/late game.      In conclusion, AP Malphite is a new way to run sorcs (even 8 sorc), that fixes the issue of not having a frontline, it is very flexible with items, since the trait bonus gives you enough damage by itself, so you can go defensive if you  . It also can have a strong early game, mid game, and late game, if you hit your  s and position well.        This is my first attempt at a guide of any kind, so feedback is cool, i'll pay attention if anyone has questions or I didn't explain something properly. Also, feedback for formatting would be nice as well, very rare for me to make a post, let alone a guide.       P.S.

Your endgame comp will pretty much look like this:      Zoe/Annie, Lux, Vel'koz, Xerath, TF, Ahri, MF, Wukong + Jayce/Mordekaiser.

I consider going for this comp when I have early AP like an Ionic Spark or Morello AND early sorcs like a TF 2 *.      **Items:**      Ionic Spark - A nobrainer, reduce MR + the zap damage insane in this comp, additionally it is an item that allows u to snowball the midgame with your vanguards.  GA - Wukong getting his ult off is crucial and since you only have 2 frontline champs having one of them revive is important.  Morello - Heal reduce and the true damage is really op.  Seraphs - Faster MF ult = faster win.  D-Cap - More MF dmg = more win.  Thieves Gloves - Always a solid one.  Any addional tank item that can stall the enemy team is good aswell.      When you get a Vel'koz from the 4 cost carousel you might   to play items on him.      **Early- / Midgame**          In the ealy and midgame you mostly   to play atleast 2 Vanguards, maybe 4 depending on your  s and lobby additionally add Sorcs. Until you find your Wukong you can even add in an additional Chrono to your TF, like a Blitzcrank, who is a very strong   because of his hook. Keep in mind that you might need to play the Backline to keep your Sorcs safe from opposing Blitzcrank hooks and share some aggro.      [Backline]       A Mordekaiser 2 * with like 2/3 Items out of Ionic / Ga / Morello will absolutely 1v9 the entire midgame.

Because you are just playing 2 frontline  s you are really susceptible to getting zehpyr'd so always keep that in mind and sacrifice one of ur weaker sorcs.      Ideally you   to winstreak through the midgame and rush level 9 asap so you have the best odds to find your MF and Xerath.      Always make sure to position your Lux relative to your opponents. You always   her to stand diagonally to the opposing carry. A single lux ult stalling the fight so your MF can get her ult off can easily win you a game.

Chrono, with Mana Printer Sona, has unique advantages that other decks do not have. See, Chrono actually have utility unmatched by other decks:  * Shen blocks all the autoattacks. * Wukong provides constant CC. * Blitzcrank pulls and CCs everyone. * And most of all, Thresh  *pulls everyone from the bench. *  Combine that with damage of Miss Fortune and Chrono-buffed Kayle, and you have a squad that has crazy utility while having enough damage.   * *The Full Team Composition * *   [Here is the team composition with Lolchess! ](   *  * *Core * *: Sona, Kayle, Soraka, Wukong, Shen  Basically,  * *Sona/Kayle * * are the duo that make this work. Sona is the Mana Printer that makes all the utility happen, and Kayle is the primary damage carry.  * *Soraka * * provides extra heal that may not be enough with Sona heal.  * *Wukong * * and  * *Shen * * are the two utilities that you cannot miss in this deck: Shen provides counter against autoattacks, while Wukong provides the CC necessary to keep the backline alive.  *  * *The Almost Necessary * *: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Miss Fortune   * *Blitzcrank * * pulls everyone, and it may as well be core because you get Blitzcrank so early.  * *Thresh * * completes the late game; this is probably the other reason why this Deck is so potent during late game. With Mana Printer Sona online, Thresh pulls a new champion into build every second or two. So you just leave someone like Lulu, Vi, Ashe, and Cho'gath in your hand, and Thresh pulls everyone in.  * *Miss Fortune * * is your secondary carry, and with Sona printing out mana, MF ult is up ridiculously fast.  * Items  With  * *Sona * *, you   2 Chalice and a Seraph. If you cannot go 2 Chalice and a Seraph, try going Shojin on someone like Soraka. You most likely need first few seconds to win anyways, With  * *Kayle * *, just go your regular Kayle item. Sometimes, you may not even need defensive items, but Sona can get blown up or get Zephyred (which is sometimes why I got 2nd or 4th; to be honest, I needed to position better.) Defensive item such as GA or Trap Claw provide utility.  With  * *Miss Fortune * *, any AP item will be okay. If you do have Bramble Vest or some other defensive items, I think putting it on  * *Shen * * should be good.  (Sorry the item theory is not strong enough; I am still learning this game! I am still Platinum I, after all.)  * Early Game/Mid Game  This is one thing that I am still mastering, so please bear with me. I generally felt that Chrono  t with Caitlyn/TF with Malphite can be a good  t. Usually, you   to intentionally lose for first few games just to guarantee yourself Tear of the Goddess. The composition stabilizes as soon as you get 2 Chalices on Sona (generally, from my experience). You can keep someone like Xayah for Kayle items.

{"title": "SET 3 EGGROLL SET 3 EGGROLL (Theorycraft)", "author": "Vexiratus", "selftext": "Hey, everyone.   My name is Vexiratus. I'm a Masters player who took a gander at the TFT [10.9 Patch Notes]  With the upcoming updates to champion odds chance in the next patch now favoring 1 costs more, I thought to do some theorycraft on the \"new eggroll\" of set 3.   For people unfamiliar with the term, eggroll was a set 2 rise of the elements comp where you spent all your gold early on trying to 3   as many specific one costs as possible, namely woodland  s and Renekton. It was an extremely powerful comp that dominated each game until all the components were nerfed.   I don't think a re-roll comp powerful to that extent is currently in the game but lets try to come close. Introducing Vanguard Xayah! Its a 4 vanguard 3 blademaster comp that relies on Xayah 3 with Statikk Shiv to carry.   [This is the most ideal version of this comp with Leona, Poppy, Mordekaiser, Fiora, Shen, and Xayah all 3  'ed]   With this, you have a powerful front line with the Vanguards that does well into the meta comps of Dark   (before Xerath) and Blaster as well as the synergistic traits of 2 chrono and blademaster that cause your Xayah to become a machine gun.       **How to Play:**  Early game should be not very different from right now. Play your strongest board while picking up the pieces of this comp. Usually, these two will go hand-in-hand as vanguards, cybernetics, and Xayah are very strong at this stage. Early pirates go a long way to maintaining health as well as gold generation. Be open to 2  ring powerful 2 costs like Lucian, Darius, and Blitzcrank.  Do not ever touch the level up button.  At 3-1, you should be level 4, 8/10 xp. At this point, you   to dump your gold into rerolls to find Xayah and co. Stop once you find Xayah 3. The rest will come with time. From then on, save your gold back up to 50, rolling any extra gold for more  s. At this point, your comp should be 2 vanguard 3 blademaster.   Wait until the beginning of round 4-6 when you have level 5, 18/20 xp and dump all your gold again. You do this to have the best odds of hitting your low cost  s.      A word of caution: When rolling it down at 3-1, always make sure to check how close you are to Xayah 3. If by 10 gold, you still aren't close to hitting her, STOP! Sometimes, the game hates you so econ back up and don't tilt roll. A delayed Xayah 3 is better than donkey rolling each round and coming up short.   After hitting all your  s, its now time to level up to put in 4 vanguard at 7. his should be your completed comp but if you have the health and money for it, going 8 and putting in 2 celestial is also a play.        **So, why is this comp going to suddenly be viable in the next patch?**   1. As previously mentioned, the changes to the champion odds at the earlier stages of the game promote the viability of hyper rolling your 1 costs, especially at level 4 with 1 cost odds going from 50 to 60%. 2. Every meta synergy including dark  s, cybernetics,   guardians, brawlers in the game is getting nerfed while 3 blademaster is untouched. 3. Vanguards are getting a HUGE buff in the early game with 2 vanguard synergy going from 60 armor to 125 armor. This allows for you to be much healthier in the early-mid game as you will be sitting on 2 vanguard 3 blademaster for quite some time before hitting all your 3  s.   4. Individual buffs to Leona and Fiora 3. 2  damage reduction and 3 second stun are always nice.  5. New Galaxies. In addition to the existing Trade Sector re-roll galaxy, there is now   Cluster Galaxy, creating 2   carousels. Snagging a 2   Xayah is huge. Treasure Trove galaxy with the extra early game gold means hitting Xayah 3 more consistently as well.       **Possible Variations on the comp:**  Suppose you are unlucky with your rolls and can't hit Xayah  s or items, what then?   1. Give up on Xayah and go for Kayle. Kayle is objectively the more consistent carry that people are running right now. Transfer the items over to her stabilize. Depending on how far you are into your Vanguards, you may   to drop them in favor of 4 chrono.  [The most common Chrono Kayle comp]   [Vanguard Variant if you are close to or have hit 3   front line.]   2. Irelia carry. You're a fighter. You won't abandon your Xayah that easily. Swap out that Shen for Irelia and throw every single sword you have on her. She will be your clean up crew, especially when Shiv has made everyone low health.   [Go 8 and put in either Thresh for Chrono or Kassadin for Celestial]       **Item priority:** bow --  tear --  rod --  Glove --  belt --  sword --  vest --  cloak  Statikk Shiv: The single most important item in this comp. Without it, Xayah is worthless.   Rageblade: With the changes to chrono, the buff is worse than before after 10 seconds but better before. Therefore, use rage blade to capitalize on that initial burst to maximize damage. This can also be a second shiv if necessary.   Defensive item:  All carries need a defensive item in this meta. I prefer trap claw the most , especially with QSS getting nerfed. GA is also fine.   Miscellaneous: Bramble vest is good on Leona, although it may be overkill. Warmogs complements the armor of the Vanguard buff with additional health. Morellonomicon on Wukong does wonders. The same goes for Ionic Spark on any Vanguard.       **Warning**  Before I finish, I   to give a warning about going this build. It is very momentum driven. The path to success with this comp is to snowball the lobby as in the end game, the comp gets steamrolled by maxed out comps. This mean/s natural rolling at least a Xayah 2 and some vanguards before 3-1.  Preserve as much health as you can and win-streak with your spent gold and early game shivs as this is not something you can pivot into from a lose streak      Thanks for reading this guide and possibly trying this comp out.

I'm currently 783 LP Challenger on the NA server and an avid brawler blaster player. Here's my LoLChess:    1. What's the comp, and what makes it good?  Your comp at 8 will be Jinx, Ezreal, Graves, Miss Fortune, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Vi, and Blitzcrank.     This teamcomp snapshot includes Aurelion Sol at level 9, with optimal postioning for most  s as well as best in slot items. This positioning allows for Jinx to get full rebel buff and benefit off of Vi + Blitzcrank synergy as well as be shielded from any dark   shacos that happen to get into the backline.  The reason this comp is great is because of the innate tankiness the brawler synergy brings combined with jinx's ridiculously high base damage lets you be threatening early and build up a sizable winstreak and health pool while still being somewhat of a threat in the late game. Ultimately, this comp is not often a first place comp but one that lets you secure top 4 finishes easily.  2. How do you play the early game?  Your best tactic early is to slam items and play your best board every round. My favorite item to  t is belt, because it builds into a lot of items that brawler blaster benefits from. The main examples are: Red buff, Redemption, Zz'rot, and Trap Claw. My favorite item to slam is by far red buff because it almost guarantees a winstreak early especially when placed on a lucian, but most items that you can slam with belt are very strong early game. Speaking of lucian, my ideal opener for a brawler blaster game has to be cybers. Cybers are great at winstreaking early because of their innate stat advantages when paired with items and they can easily take advantage of the broken   that is graves to give blaster synergy.  3. When do you roll?  The optimal time to roll for brawler blaster is 90% of the time gonna be level 8 at 4-3. This gives you a really good chance at jinx 2 as well as hitting upgrades on your frontline as well as hitting an MF. The other 10% of the time is when you either already have a jinx 2 and are winstreaking your nuts off in which case you can go 9 fast and roll down for aurelion, MF 2 and even possibly a Jinx 3, or you've lost a shit ton of health and need to stabilize at 7 and thereby forfeit your chance at going 9 that game. Once you hit jinx 2 and mf and most of your frontline upgraded though, that's the best time to go 9.   That's most of what I have to say, but I'll be answering as many questions as I can about the comp in the comments as well as on stream at   if anyone  s to tune in.

{"title": "[DISCUSSION] When to Winstreak, Lose Streak, and Managing Early Econ", "author": "Apricotjello", "selftext": "I tanked my elo pretty hard at the beginning of the patch because I kept trying to hard-force the meta comps while tunneling on their ideal late-game. I was holding Karmas when I forced DS at the cost of my econ, or trying to force 3DS + 2 sorc  ts which basically ints early game. I dropped from Masters to D2 and realized I needed to work on my early game. Since then I have climbed back into Masters by planning my game less around a forced comp and more around maximizing the resources I get from small voids + Kayn.   I try to win-streak hard every game - I have mentioned in prior posts that I believe HP is an undervalued resource and that the wonky carousels really punish loss-streakers (who cannot rely on getting their items).           My post discusses the types of  ts and both good and bad-case scenarios for each type as a baseline strategy.     In my experience, there are three basic types of resource  ts:  1) Item heavy. Including carousel, you end up with no gold and 4 or 5 components.   * You need to identify if you can possibly level to 4 at 2-1 or 2-2 with two very strong items and sustain a win-streak. I think this is only possible with 1 *  s if you can combine two powerful traits like cyber/blaster, brawler/blaster, chrono/frontline, etc. Strong early game items that will provide late game comps value include GA, GS, Red buff, DCap, ZZrot, BV, BT, Zephyr (always an underrated option if you have belt+cloak since they usually suck), and Guinsoo's.  * If you have awful components AND lots of pairs but no/bad 2 *  s, do not level to four. Int to 2-3 and prioritize making a BiS item for your comp by carousel, especially if it comes on a key   (i.e. Rod on Kaisa, Bow or Vest on Yi, anything on Shaco, etc.)   2) Gold heavy. You have 1 or 2 components and 7+g in addition to many bench pairs or combined  s. This includes  ts where you get either a useful 3 *   like Yi/Vi/Rumble or a trash one like Karma (sell 99% of the time to hit 10g econ breakpoint).    * Best case scenario involves hitting multiple key  s for a powerful comp. Yi+Yas, Shaco+DS, space pirates, brawler blasters, etc. Push levels and try to streak into first carousel. Consider leveling again at 2-5 to fast five, but holding only your most essential  s so you have a chance to hit 10g. A win-streak through krugs and third stage will be win condition so try to play very strong boards.   * Worst case scenario is the above but you alternate between wins and losses in 2-x and 3-x. Manage your econ extremely tightly and consider pivoting to the best comp the game gives you and avoid contesting players who have better econ+boards than you.  * Medium case scenario is that you have a ton of gold, trash  s, and no good items. Econ up and try to play a strong late-game comp like Dark  s while playing solid boards like chrono/vg, sniper celestial prots, or 1 * jayce + darius + vg + snipers.   3) Mix. You usually get three components and gold but maybe got neekos, an extra component, or spats.  * Best case scenario is hitting Neekos and good items for a meta comp. You can guarantee your 2 * mf/xerath/lulu and should power-level hard to get to them first, shutting out anyone who contests you. Use your strong items in transitional comps to win as many matches as you can and lose hp minimally to the strongest boards, never rerolling. This is where a lot of players get baited into running 3-5ds boards and straight inting; prioritize 2 * 1-cost  s over weak traits  * Worst case scenario is you have three bad components and no strong  s. Consider running cybers - even with two 1 * cybers, slamming components on all 3 - and hold  s on your bench ready to pivot to a different comp at the best 3-cost or 4-cost   you see.       Some other thoughts:  * I don't like cybers much as a late-game  t. Even if I have a great cyber  t, 99% of the time I try to pivot to brawler blasters.  * Slow-roll compositions are all still really good if they're uncontested and you have perfect  s coming out of early game. They usually don't win but will almost always top-4. SGs might suck (idk still), but celestial prots are super underrated. Blade Bros and Space Jam are both viable. I especially recommend them on reroll galaxies with a gold-heavy  t.   * Xerath 2 with any reasonable items is a win condition. Consider forcing DS if you have a winstreak on neekoverse or neekos from boxes and can guarantee hitting 8/9 faster than other DS players.", "id": "g8bzab", "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1587896106},

Most items find a spot in this build though, but those are the most important to getting Darius and Jayce online early  * Prioritize Graves, Blasters, and obviously Darius and Jayce  * Should be strong if you find Space Pirates, but even if you are not streaking, that's OK  **Mid Game**  * Level 6 on either 3-2 or 3-5, depending on gold and relative strength  * Reroll enough to stabilize and get core build online  * OK to drop below 50 gold if you can find all 2- s on core  s, Space Pirates make that gold back quickly  * After getting 2- s, slow roll for 3- s  **Late Game**  * Level 7 after finding multiple 3- s, ideally Darius and Xin, since their odds drop at level 7  * Rarely go to 8, only if all 3- s and still have plenty of gold  * You have a lot of options for items from carousels and Kayn, so almost anything is useful on one of your  s  * Don't do 4 Space Pirates, just don't  **When to Play**  * You can make an early Jeweled Gauntlet and/or IE  * You have an early Jayce or Darius, even at 1-   * You are NOT on Neekoverse, on this galaxy, other players will hit power spikes in the midgame when you are supposed to be strong, so it is much weaker.

{"title": "Just hit Plat 4 on mobile. Here are some thoughts/things to look out for if you're thinking about trying to play or climb with your phone or tablet.", "author": "judgeshandiwork", "selftext": "Hey all. I didn't play set 1 and capped at gold 2 during set two. This season I've  ted paying attention and learning about the game and was able to hit plat without much trouble, around 65~ games.   I did most of this on mobile because at the beginning of this set my laptop was stolen. I have a couple of insights I'd like to share.   Firstly, I think TFT is perfectly playable on mobile. The UI fits nicely on my phone, and my roll down speeds are about the same as on PC. I think it's perfectly possible to play at a reasonably high level on mobile, and it's a nice environment for learning the basics of the game and improving your play/understanding of the game to an extent.   That being said, there are different challenges present when playing on mobile. If you're considering playing on mobile and trying to improve while doing it, here are some things to think about.   - Be more careful than you would on PC when itemizing. Putting items on champions is a little clunky at the moment, and it's really easy when playing a comp like rebels to throw a seraphs on Master Yi instead of ASol on accident. Not much they could do about this because of the screen size, but you definitely have to be more careful on mobile. It's also more difficult to throw items on champions mid-round.   - Scouting is really difficult to do smoothly. I accidentally return to my own board constantly and it makes it confusing to see how many people are running each comp. Take scouting a bit slower for a single smoother sweep of the lobby rather than doing a couple of sweeps like you would on PC.   - Positioning is the real barrier to higher level play in my opinion. The scouting difficulties exacerbate it, but it's just impossible for me to completely rearrange my team unless I have the full thirty seconds, or at least most, to do it. If I scout something with like ten seconds left to adjust to it on PC, it's no issue, but on mobile it's like  welp guess i know how I'm losing this round.  This means you have to be a little more proactive if you anticipate having to reposition.   - Sometimes, moving your little legend around during carousel can be a little wonky, which makes it hard to get the item you're looking for. It got better though, I believe they may have tried to fix it recently, but it's still an issue once in a while.   - This is not super relevant for the competitive side, and I know it's difficult to fit in, but a chat feature during the game would add lots of fun to it. I miss lobby chats. As well as league voice for parties.   Because of these small handicaps, I would find it hard to imagine someone getting above mid diamond on mobile. Like I said, it's playable for sure, but it's difficult to do the small things that can sometimes make or break a round, especially later in the game. This might be different if you're using a tablet rather than a phone, but to a lesser extent I imagine these difficulties probably still apply.   Just felt like sharing.   Thanks for reading, hope this information is useful to someone!

{"title": "Reached Diamond within a week with 0 knowledge", "author": "SirCorsica", "selftext": "Hi All,  I haven't played TFT since Set1 as I got bored of people only spamming the same comps over and over and stopped playing on Platinum II and I decided to give it a try this set as I heard it has a decent balance.  So this past Monday 13 I  ted (with a new account I'm current leveling) on Bronze II after placements and ended up today Diamond IV having low or no clue of the game status on day 1.        I  ed to do this post as a few friends asked me for tips about the comps as they are a little stuck, so there we go:  I used  [TFTactics.gg app]  previously on Set1 to manage comps and roll percentage of  s and decided to take a look as you can see top comps and items they should use.  April 13 was still 10.7 so this app was showing top comps 1.Cybernetics Blademasters 2.Mech Infiltrators(Shaco carry) 3.  Guardian Sorcerer if my memory is correct.  After having a quick look I searched on google and reddit and decided I  ed to play mainly Mech as I found really fun watching Gigant Garen smashing  s  While searching I read [this TFT comp sheet]  which made me realise Shaco shouldn't be the carry, it was Kai'sa really the hard carry providing CC with Demolitions Charge. I make emphasis on this as it is really important to compare different points of view to get a personal conclusion for any comp in order to identify the strong and weak points.  I tried a few games and my game plan was rolling at 7 to hit  s but I identified I was taking too much damage on early game and reaching mid-late game really low.    So I stopped playing and  ted searching new post or videos and I found this [Saintvicious video.]     This game is a perfect game played of Mecha comp and I tried to emulate everything until I could understand when should I roll or econ for  s. So copying him I was on 2-3 trying to hit 20g, on 3-2 try to hit 6 and slow roll for  s etc...   This gave me the a patern to follow while I was trying items and learning.    Later I realised I needed for my Mecha Titans Resolve and Quicksilver as first items and then get a Large Rod towards Demolitions Charge or go for Morello as second item if I didn't get spatula, Morello will come later but Seraph's will come in between both, I just leave the Large Rod in Kai'sa meanwhile looking for spatula.  At this point I had a pretty strong comp which I knew how to reach top 5 constantly but I kept lacking of good early game so I kept focusing on improving this, even now I feel my early not consistent enough as I would like to.  So 10.8 gets here and at this point I am mostly Platinum III- Platinum II and a little bit bored with Mech. Mech is still a top comp but   Guardian Sorcerer is more powerful than ever and I decide to try it and spam it in order to learn it even if in the lobby 2-3 people end with same comp. The TFT app that I used shows currently 1.   Guardian Sorcerer 2. Mech 3. Dark  s.  New comp implies reading new guides and understanding at least a little bit how it works, so I read this [Challenger post thoughts on 10.8]  and this [  Guardian guide]     There is always at least one other player playing this comp every lobby but mostly doesn't realise that Neeko is the main carry and not Syndra. They kept rushing Syndra items and having a strong mid-game but as they lack of Neekos items they won't have a good late game in which I normally will win against them and later take their  s.  From the Challenger guy post we get [this]  comp items and placement and it's totally correct.   Other good point he makes is on rolling on level 7 until you get Neeko 3 and Syndra 3 and then going back to eco, this is really important as you will be econ for level 8 and 9 as this patch we see more level 9 than even the previous one, I remember Set1 that going towards 8 was maybe 1 o 2 rounds before ending 9 was rarely seen.  Neeko needs Ionic Spark to deal damage early-mid game and GA to revive and land at least 2 ultimates stunning enemy frontlane and even infiltrators and buying a lot of time for sorcerers to  t dealing damage with their ultimates, third item is Quicksilver if you don't feel comfortable evading Zephyr which was my case.  After Neeko we prioritize Syndra as it will be the one killing people from their backline, we will give her 2 Seraph's and Challice if we can to give mana to near allies with [this formation]     On the other hand we have Poppy in what seems a weird position but it is the best for her as she would walk between Neeko and Sorcerers and block any frontline that passes while Neeko respawns from GA and even tanking infiltrators.   If we get spatula or reach level 9 in this comp we will make Vel'koz   Guardian and remove Poppy to get 6 sorcerer buff.  On overall I find this patch pretty balanced as comps like protectors, chrono, blademasters or brawlers can win a game if they are smart with items buying armor or magic resist if they run agains strong Mechs or   Guardian-Sorcerers respectively.      Looking back is a really long post but if it helps at least one player on improving I will be happy about it.  Thanks for reading!", "id": "g4ih7r", "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1587341397}, 
{"title": "Mini-Guide: Fast Friends (Kayle   Xerath)", "author": "tinkady", "selftext": "TL;DR: Xerath scales really well with attack speed! Pew pew pew. He's basically a legendary version of Kayle. They are friends who like to attack fast. Friends are better together. [Level 9 comp]   So I really  ed to play Chrono Xerath. What I've decidd is that you shouldn't play Chrono Xerath. You can't reliably find him, let alone 2   him (except for in the Neekoverse), and he's also too squishy to play as a primary carry since he doesn't use GA well (dies during ult, wakes up with no mana). Bad results in high ELO.  But there is hope! I'm sure most of you are familiar with Chrono Kayle. Standard level 7 core:   Kayle / Kassadin / Xayah / Shen / 3 Chronos  4 Chrono, 3 blademaster, 2 celestial  Kayle likes GA / Rageblade / RFC, HoJ, etc.  The standard level 8 is to add Miss Fortune for Valkyrie. This is good, but another arguably better option is to play Xerath (with Twisted Fate). 20% spell damage for the team is comparable to 25% damage on Kayle + MF, and Xerath scales way better with Chrono than MF.   Here's the final [level 9 comp]   ***Xerath / Twisted Fate*** / Kayle / MF / Kassadin / Xayah / Thresh / Shen / Wukong  4 Chrono, 3 blademaster, 2 valkyrie, 2 celestial, 2 mana reaver, **2 sorcerer**  Now you have three hypercarries and will stomp on some fools. So basically, just play the regular Chrono Kayle team, but keep this transition in mind. That means hold on to at least one Twisted Fate and prioritize Xerath items after your Kayle is done. These are:  QSS, Trap Claw / Rageblade / Deathcap, HoJ, Shiv, Morello, Jeweled Gauntlet, Gunblade, etc.  BTW, Xerath works with Blademaster spatula!

{"title": "Challenger   Guardian Only Guide", "author": "dennisj9", "selftext": "Hi All,   My name is The Great Lakes and I'd like to share some insight on   Guardians with you.    I'm an Assistant Principal who has found some extra time to play TFT after Covid-19 effectively ended the school year, so I decided to hit Challenger this set by forcing   Guardians only.   I have played 1    Guardian games straight from Diamond 4 to Challenger without pivoting once.     **Why do I never pivot?** Well, I'm actually not very good at the game and the fluid transitional period of pivoting makes me feel uncomfortable. Also, I'm used to being a 1-trick wonder. In 2013 I was a semi-pro league player throughout season 3 by playing only Jungle Leona every game. (Leona Gone Wild)    ;  **Here is some advice and a few misconceptions that I   to clear up when playing   Guardians.**    ;  **1. Stop calling it egirls:** Last set we called 6 Beserkers  Beserkers  and 6 Inferno   Infernos . Rangers? You guessed it, Rangers. 6 Yordles - Yordles, 6 Nobles - Nobles, 6 Brawlers - Brawlers, etc. The list goes on. You sound like my edgy high school students when you call it egirls. If you   to be good at 6   Guardians, call it   Guardians or SG. If you take anything away from this post, it should be this.    ;  **2a. Neeko is more important than Syndra:** I often see players rushing to get those tears and build a Seraph's for Syndra as fast as they can when playing   Guardians. Brother, let me tell you about my good friend Neeko. Neeko is not only your only solid frontline champion, but her CC is amazing. A strong vs weak Neeko will absolutely decide the outcome of your game. If Neeko melts, suddenly the entire team is in your backline. However, a strong Neeko will hold entire teams at a standstill, apply morellos, and give your backline an ample amount of time to win the game. Neeko's perfect items are GA, Morello's, and Spark. With these items, in most games Neeko will typically be your main damage dealer as well as your tank, especially if she is 3- red.    ;  **2b. GA is your most important item, not Seraph's:** The #1 item that you need every game is a GA on Neeko, not a Seraph's on Syndra. If Neeko doesn't get her ult off, you will not be winning that round. GA is crucial for this. This item will be priority #1, then you can build seraphs or any other item you   in any other order. You can win games with a weak Syndra as there are other damage dealers on your team. You won't win any games with a weak Neeko.    *I like to sacrifice Poppy or Zoe to the Zephyr gods, but if this is proving difficult, drop the spark for QSS on Neeko.    ;  **3. It's okay to be contested:** There is this notion that there can only be 1 successful   Guardian player in a lobby, that you need everything 3- red to place well and contesting is a 7/8  holding hands  situation. While 3- ring  your champs will increase your strength, it's okay to share. I'm contested all the time, but I still found a way to hit Challenger with a single comp.  Keep in mind, the current strategy of slow rolling at level 7 goes out the window when you are contested. You have a very limited mathematical chance of 3- ring 3-cost  s if another player is attempting to do the same. However, you can still do well in the lobby. If another player is contesting you, do not stay on level 7 longer than it takes to 2-  everything, then move onto 8. Large magic damage lobby? Toss Lulu into your build asap for Mystic. Large physical damage lobby? Wukong has been a strong asset for vanguards and CC. Wukong will typically ult right after Neeko creating a quality CC chain as well.  Try to keep some econ if you can manage it. Once a contesting player dies, that is your chance to roll down for 3- s. At level 8, 35% for 3-cost champs still gives you a great chance for 3-  Neeko, Lux, and Syndra.    ;  **4. Why is your win rate so bad?:** You will finish 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quite often with   Guardians, especially, if you are in a contested lobby and are trying to outlast the person contesting you. It's cool though, because the LP gains are pretty consistent.    ;  **5. Spatula Items:** Remember when I said GA was the most important item? I lied to you. The   Guardian Charm is. If you see a sweet, sweet spat on the carousel, you go get it brother. Most of my 1st place victories come from 6 Sorc, 6   Guardian games. The   Guardian item goes directly onto a VelKoz as soon as you can, drop the Poppy, and add a TF/Annie/Xerath.    ;  **6. What do I do with bows?:** Avoid bows at all costs on carousels. If you get a bow, there are two options: Throw a Zz'rot on Poppy (Not Neeko). Neeko has a GA and will survive the duration of the fight, thus never utilizing Zz'Rot. Poppy, however, dies quite often and quite early in fights giving you an extra frontline. If you get 2 bows, make an RFC and put it on Soraka for extra long bananas. Ahri can't make use of it as it messes up her ult and Soraka casts less due to her ult cost allowing her to auto attack more.    ;  **7. Final Comp at 8:** Without a   Guardian Charm your comp will be the 6   Guardians, Lux, and Lulu. With the   Guardian Charm, you will place the   guardian Charm on Vel'Koz, use the   Guardians minus Poppy, and add Lux with TF/Annie/Xerath for 6 Sorc, 6   Guardian.    ;  **8. Positioning:** Geckos in the front, ladies in the back. Lux and Zoe should be on the furthest ends of your team. All the sorcerers should be in a line on the back row. Except for Ahri, her range is only 660 and you   here orb to hit as many people as possible. I like to place Ahri in front of Syndra. If you are getting man handled by infiltrators, move Ahri to the back row and place Poppy and Lulu in front of your Ahri and Syndra. Be sure to watch out for the human plagues that put Zephyr on Blitz. If infiltrators are not a problem, place Poppy right next to Neeko to eat Zephyrs and man reavers.    ;  **9a. Leveling:** Even with the new player damage changes, I still econ to 7 and slow roll from there. If you are taking a lot of damage, I may roll down a small amount at 6 to stabilize but never more than 8 gold or so. The exception to this rule is the new FoN at level 5 galaxy. If you do not hit level 5 when your opponents do, the power differential is too much and you will lose too much health early. I usually wait until after the round 3 carousel to level to 6, but you need to watch what your opponents are doing. If you have a streak and they all level to 6 on 3-2, you probably should too. If you have too little health and they all level to 6 on 3-2, you may need to as well.   If you are contested, try to level to 8 a little after raptors. You most likely aren't going to 3-  many  s until your competition has died, so you need to find other means to power spike. Lulu has served me well and so has Wukong for that final 8th spot.    ;  **#9b. Rolling:** As stated above, slow roll to level 7.    Late Game: So, you've made it to late game. You are level 7 with 50 gold. Now what? Rolling the last of your gold depends on your health and your power spike potential. Try to roll down the last of your gold before it's too late to make a comeback. ~30 health is good because if you drop a game by chance you aren't out of the game. If you are being contested, try to wait until your competition has left the game to roll down if possible.   Disregard the previous advice if you are sitting on 7 or 8 Neekos and Syndras after raptors. The power spike from getting these  s to 3-  will change the trajectory of your game greatly. It's worth hamstringing your economy after raptors if you can go on a quality win streak and power spike by spending the gold.    ;  **#10.

{"title": "Mech infiltrators idea", "author": "TheGuardian25", "selftext": "I  ed to share a trick that has won some of my latest games.(plat-diamond 4 elo)  Everyone knows the new addition to the comp, where the win condition sometimes is putting in a sorcerer(usually lux). What I've discovered, is that a xerath instead of lux is absolutely op, especially if you can get an infiltrator spat, since he benefits from the AS. This works only if u have the health and economy to push 8, after you achieve annie, rumble, shaco and kai sa 3  (or at least the ones you realistically can 3  , depending whether they're contested or not)  If u don't have a QSS or a Trap claw for xerath, just put kayle in the corner, so she's getting hooked by blitz(which is a solid counter for any   that's not jumping to the back) and kayle is useless anyway so it doesn't matter.  The goal would be to go 6 infiltrators if u can find 2 spats, but a simple 2   xerath with infiltrator spat(so 5 infiltrators) would probably do the job.   Hope this helps you get more 1st places, since Jhin comps usually reap through the mech pretty fast.

{"title": "Challenger 730LP Initial Thoughts on 10.8 Meta and Brief Comps Guide - Chatskiiees!", "author": "Chatskiiees", "selftext": "Hey reddit! I'm a challenger player on OCE in all 3 sets of tft and masters in NA (after about 50 games). You may have seen a similar post by me regarding the [10.7 patch]  which due to its success i've decided to do again! After playing 30 or so games on the first day in a mixture of challenger OCE/NA i have a pretty good idea about which comps will be strong. Use this as a way to get  ted in 10.8 until the meta settles and maybe get a little free LP before everyone catches on. If you have any questions feel free to leave them here or ask me on my stream ([twitch.tv/chatskiiees]  i should be live for the next 6 hours or so after this post goes live. Let's get into it!  # Key Information (Gameplay)  * The player damage change should not be ignored. Fast 9 is completely gone and fast 8 is impossible without a highroll  t of good  s, econ and winstreak. This isn't just due to the player damage but also the perception of the player damage. People are rolling on 7 at 4-1 often and the level to 6 at 3-2 and roll meta is seeing a resurgence.  * Due to the player damage changes, compositions that rely on 5cost  s are weaker. Lose streaking is much lower priority but if you are you HAVE to ensure you are killing some of their  s or you are going to be forced to play for top 4. The nerf to the cyber trait is unnoticeable but getting to 8 as cybers is much less forgiving (see below on my opinion on how to play cybers in 10.8). Similar comps that run 4 cost carries but rely on a 5 cost to spike (such as dark   Jhin needing lulu) roll on 7 now almost always and find the 5 cost during mid stage 5 after econing back up from when they hit their carry. * Reroll compositions like bang bros, sorcs and mech/inf are going to be strong due to them rolling earlier than other comps and staying healthy, while also having a strong late game due to 3    s. The only comp i see contesting these for first are dark  s. Don't play protectors though they are terrible and lose to all the meta comps (sorcs dark   and bang bros, also gunmay's squidy comp beats it 50/50) * You can't be afraid to role on this patch. If you are getting 5-0e'd in stage 3 you are taking 11 damage and you are going to bleed out. Pivot your comp to a 7 endgame version (or 8 if you can stabilise successfully) to play for top 4 when you have lowrolled the early game. * You have to be a Chad to come first on this patch. 10.8 1st's will only come playing uncontested compositions. Make sure you talk shit and spam ping other players to ensure they know you are going a composition and question mark them if they contest. * The 9   synergies i have not seen in all my games but these seem pretty overkill to me and should not be a goal unless you   to make a disguised toast video. * Mechs feel like they got buffed not nerfed. 10.7 favours mech/kai sa carry as opposed to shaco so the nerfs to him don't effect the comp much. The bug fix to the mech with it now having guaranteed infiltrator feels like more of a buff than the nerf to the hp in all honesty.   # Key Information (Galaxies/Items/ s)  * The trade galaxy (free reroll every turn) is now my personal favourite and makes you feel like you're on top of the world... until you realise everyone else is also massively highrolling because they get double the rolls too. Scouting is very important in this galaxy because if u fall behind you are going to get 6-0ed and bleed out. A common mistake i also see is failure to econ in this galaxy. Remember, everyone else is strong too so unless u have a guaranteed streak make sure you are getting interest or you are going to fall behind. * The superdense galaxy (free fon at level 5) from what i've seen is a rush 5 must. You cannot stay at 4 on the post-carousel stage 2 or you are going to get rolled by the two   disadvantage and take 20hp dmg over the two turns. Consider this galaxy to have a similar principle as the medium legends galaxy, where you are planning a level 9 late game rather than a level 8, but without the need to econ to 9. This lack of a need to go to 9 means many people are strong in this galaxy so a comp with a strong lategame should be played. * Velkoz kinda slaps now. The brain buffs that riot gave him feel pretty decent and he is going to have a lot less people yelling at him for miss clicking his ult. * Xerath is not good. Sure he can be played in 6 dark   but i never see items stacked on him becasue he is obtained much to late and he doesn't fit sorcs at all either due to the 6   guardians. He is too hard to itemise in dark  s since you   items on shaco and jhin, neither of which have tear or rod components. The only time he could possibly be a carry is in the neekoverse. * The nerf to tear is extremely small and does not stop seraph / chalice being very good items in   guardians. Tear outside of this composition is weak as it was in 10.7. * The buff to Firecannon makes Yi the Bangest Bro (see below for my opinion on bang bros for 10.8) but outside of this it is much the same. * Don't sleep on Zekes Herald. This item received an overkill buff and is a very solid choice in a lot of compositions that don't prioritise BF and belt (cybers, kayle) * Rebels still dead  # 10.8 Team Compositions  [S+   guardians]  With the chalice buffs, soraka buffs, syndra buffs, 4 sorc buffs this comp went from broken as fuck in 10.7 to BROKEN AS FUCK in 10.8. I've played around 10 games of this composition and have not gotten below second when uncontested and not below 4th when contested. Play this comp if you don't like having fun and like winning. I expect this comp to end up in a similar place as ocean mage was last set, with a transition away from syndra carry when the comp is contested. Run 3   guardians prioritising neeko items and roll at 7 till you have neeko and syndra 2   and hopefully 6   guardians. After that econ back to 50 and slow roll for syndra/neeko 3 or go to 8 for mystic if contested and run velkoz carry.  [S+ Mech Infiltrators]  Same shit different patch this comp is not going anywhere soon. Still a very strong composition when played uncontested but a little more punishing when multiple people are playing. Shaco got a little weaker as a 3   but given a bt and ga he will still 1v4 the remainder of an enemy's team, though you should not prioritise his items over kaisa/mech. Slow roll at 6 till you hit your  s (annie and kai sa) then go to 7 prioritising valkyrie. Very similar to last patch. It should be noted that garen still doesn't get the team buffs like sorc and mystic on away boards but he always gets the   synergies. Demo spat kaisa is the top 1 win condition.  [S Bang Bros and/or 6 Blademasters.]  Yi and Yasuo are back in 10.8 and are looking to smash. The OCE special has gained potency with the buffs and i have been experimenting with several versions of this composition. With this comp i econ to 6, scout whether i am contested. If i am uncontested i slow roll for yi/yasuo/sona/shen/blitz 3 (in that order of priority) at 6 and stack yi with items (the 3 in the imgur link are my opinion for BIS on 10.8) If contested, i econ to 7 after stabilizing with 2    s at 6 on what is usually a small rolldown (often staying above 50) then try to run kayle as my carry in a 6bm version. With these yi items as the goal you can easily transition them to kayle if you are contested so you shouldn't have any worries shoving guinsoo early game. Ensure you run celestial and mana reaver at 7 with kassadin.  [S 6 Dark  s.]  Jhin is still a big boy and will carry your team with the right items. The vanguard version of this comp is going to be weaker in the late game due to sorcs and magic damage carries being decent but can still be played for a strong mid game. Mordekaiser 3 with tank items can be a win condition in this comp but it is rare due to him being a very contested  . I almost always roll at 7 for 2   jhin before going to 8 with this comp due to him being contested and to prevent bleeding out. Don't run 3 dark   in the mid game over something like 4 vanguard or some brawlers as frontline is what this composition lacks. Transition to 6 dark   at 8 or at 7 if you are close to morde 3/have a 2   wukong or jayce and can fit it. Don't build ie on jhin its overkill lw is better.  [A+ Gunmay's Calamari Brawlers.]  With the Vel'koz brain buffs this comp can do quite well, but usually won't win without Vel'koz 3. It's played much the same as the last patch with 4 brawlers being the core to getting through the early-mid game with a roll down for Vel'koz on 7.  [A+ 4 Chrono Kayle]  This comp would be S tier if not for the fact that kayle is extremely contested. In all my games there are at least 2 people going for kayle 2 and about an average of 4 players looking for her since she is such an overtuned  . The nerfs to valkyire are not that bad and it is still very much worth playing. 4 chrono lets you play all the good chrono  s and with this comp i like to roll at 7 for kayle 2 if i think i'm weak or at 8 if i have been win streaking. Prioritise kayle items and Zekes in this build and make sure you only go fast 8 if you are healthy or you will die. Kayle 3, double zekes mf with perfect kayle items or a lowroll lobby are these comps win conditions.  [A Cybernetiks.]  The composition i played the most on 10.7 certainly feels weaker. Cybers was very reliant on getting to 9 in order to run both valkyrie and mana reaver. Going to 9 is only possible with a strong mid and early game so lose streak cybers is very terrible. I have still had success with this comp with a lot of early crit gloves. Make sure you are winstreaking and try to fast 8, rolling at 7 if you haven't found any irelias or any kayle's. I like to run 4 chrono 3 blademaster and 2 vanguards at 7 to get to 8 with a caitlyn or graves holding my irelia items. If you haven't made the irelia items and have excess bows consider pivoting to kayle carry if you hit.  **My Secret Comp (A-S) GUIDE COMING SOON STAY TUNED!**  **Protectors F-** If you like winning do not play this comp it loses to everything. Roll at level 3 if you   to play this so your misery can end faster. I'm not trying to be clever so i'm the only one playing this comp it is terrible you've been warned.  # Final Thoughts and TL/DR  This patch feels like theres several options that you can top 1 with, but the dissapointing part is contestion. You aren't going to 1st playing any of the S tier comps when contested unless they mess up and the  s open up while you are still healthy. DO NOT BLEED OUT! If you are losing you need to do something whether it is level/roll or both Mort has said they   people to be able to die before 4-7 and if you do you gonna tank ur LP.

{"title": "Guardians of the Galaxy - 10.8", "author": "wingnut124", "selftext": "**Guardians of the Galaxy**  Hello, I'm Travis, I peaked in OCE at rank 4 and love theory crafting whether the build becomes successful or not.  **Key Notes:**   -These 3 cost  s have been uncontested in the current meta. Hence, don't try this build if  s are contested.   -Going into Bangbros; Ashe will need fewer items then Jayce so Yasuo doesn't ult her.  Bangbros comp:      This comp will work better if other level 3  s are being contested. Hence, it will thin out the pool and let you naturally hit a Jayce 3 and Kassadin 3 and possibly an Ashe 3 (optional).  **Key items:**  This is not an item dependant comp. However, items are still up for experimentation.   Jayce into AP (Bramble, dragon claw and QSS)  Jayce into AD (Bramble, Titans and QSS)  **Who's my carry?**  Your carry will be a 3 item stacked Jayce/Kassadin with 40% healing from the celestial buff.  **Early game:**  Hitting 2 pirates in the early game can allow you to win-loss-win-loss-etc due to gold compensation. However, you can defiantly win streak with 2 pirates and 3 cybernetics. Scatter your items on the cybernetics accordingly for the extra hp and damage.  **Open Fort (Optional):**  This will allow you to hit perfect items and a loss streak. However, you will need to stabilize around level 6 since this is a level 7 roll down comp and you dont   to tank too much hp. Also, open forting should be done in most medium legend galaxy games.  **Mid Game/Late Game:**  Struggling in the mid-game might require you to stabilize at level 6. However, you will need to level to 7 asap.  At level 7 you will need to slow roll for your 3 cost  s. The probability of hitting a 3 cost   is 40%. However, the percentages are subject to change if the other 3 cost  s are being contested.  You also have a 1% chance at hitting a 5 cost. Hence, this means you can hit a gangplank while rolling for your 3 cost  s. Hence, you can run 4 space pirates in the mid-late game for the item drop then transition out of it later. Unless you high roll a demo-spat.  **Counters:**  Will be playing a few games and getting back to this.  **Early Game:**  Level 5: 3 cybernetic / 2 space pirate / 2 blaster / 2 Vanguard     **Mid Game:**  Level 6: 3 cybernetic / 2 space pirate / 2 Vanguard / 2 Mana-Reaver     **Late Game:**  Level 7: 2 space pirate / 2 mana-reaver / 4 celestial / 2 sniper         **End Game variations:**  Level 8: 4 space pirate / 4 celestial / 2 mana-reaver / 1 mercenary      Level 8: 2 space pirate / 4 celestial / 2 mana-reaver / 2 sniper / 2 mystic     **If you're snowballing with gold:**  Level 9: 4 space pirate / 4 celestial / 2 mana-reaver / 2 sniper / 1 mercenary     This is rough theory crafting and subject to change.

They should be facing the far right Krug. The reasoning for this is simple; you   to focus down all the damage on one Krug (as they do hurt weak 1 *  s as well as regenerate health for the others as you kill one, so FOCUS FIRE)     We will be using Aurelion Sol to show the spacing since we don't see the poor guy anymore.  For this we will be assuming that your  s have similar items to each other (none/non tank components), obviously if your 2 * Fiora has bramble vest that they can be in this spot.  **Row 1: Tank|Melee  s**, the one in the FAR LEFT should always be your tankiest   usually as it will be eventually drawing the aggro of all 3 krugs usually, center one should be your second beefiest   as it is your back up tank if the first should die as well may draw aggro from the initial Krug, the one in right corner should be Melee damage such as Shaco (which as an infiltrator normally jumps behind krugs and you DO NOT   this as it can mess up the krug aggro to crush krusty the clown, leave that to patch 10.8 balance changes) or champions like Graves which smokes the furthest   helping your left   tank.  **Good Candidates for the far tanking job** (and middle tank): Vanguards (Poppy/Leona/Morde) except Jayce (Jayce is an exception as you   him either in far right or middle so he can slam on all 3 krugs usually). Malphite (he knows how to deal with his own kind), Shen with chain vest (though I find he still serves better as a middle tank) Xin Zhao is ok but better as a middle tank as he is not innately tanky.  **Row 2: 420 Range  s**  - This is mainly for  s such as Annie (which can sometimes serve as a middle tank for row 1 if she has an armor/titans resolve that you have slammed) protectors like Neeko or Rakan that you   to build up mana before hitting their AOE spell and keep the krugs locked up without taking initial damage. Blitzcrank if you have to play him for brawler/Chrono synergy should be in row 2 far left | Kai'sa can also go far right in this row if she does not have morellos. |  **Row 3: 660 Range  s**:Generally here you will be running some form of Chrono   this patch, so twisted fate is probably the   you will find in this spot, or whatever other 660 range   you may have, pretty simple.  **Row 4: 860+ | Infiltrator  s**:Again pretty simple, you   stuff like Caitlyn, Zoe, etc to just not be in range of getting beat up, I just sort it in the 4 rows to keep it organized, you also   to bottom right corner Kai'sa if she has morellos as she will jump to a spot where she can apply anti heal to all 3 krugs/burn them.  example in the tl;dr  Main Tank- row 1 (far right -3)  Middle/Off Tank- row 1 (far right -2)  Melee Carry- row 1 (far right)  420 rng - row 2 (far right or -1)  Blitzcrank row 2  (AKA Mr.tow truck far right -2)  660 rng - row 3 (far right or -1)  860+ rng - row 4 (far right or -1)  Kai'sa with morellos -  ^ same  ^  *Honestly this should already be the end of the guide and your winrate for Krugs should go up to 90%+ but since we're already here let's go over a few more things like items and synergies.*   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Item Tier List:** Rocks are tanky, and to fight a tank battle, it only makes sense for you to make a tank as well.  Tier S: Bramble  Tier A: Titans Resolve | Red Buff | Morellos |  Tier rest: Bow stuff | Tear stuff| Rod stuff | Health stuff .. ok I mean anything that gives stats is good, slam it if you need.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Synergies Tier List:**  Tier S: Vanguard | Brawler | Chrono (if you have one of these synergies it makes it so much easier, chrono+either brawler/vanguard is almost a guaranteed clear).  Tier rest: Protector   celestial? rest? , you shouldn't really be running anything else but if you are forcing a comp, try to get your best synergy out then.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  TL;DR: put  s right side, tanks in front. put armor/hp on left main tank, build anti heal; fail to krugs after this guide because rock smash.. and cry yourself to sleep.  Here's a sample picture applying the concepts I've mentioned with Poppy/Neeko/Annie/Caitlyn, a team that has no synergies but can clear with optimal positioning and a 2 * or bramble.    *Yeah well that's it guys, don't wanna keep you here any longer, need to get back to clearing more Krugs, peace and good luck on the grind.*  *ROCK ON*", "id": "g0dv6y", "num_comments": 58, "created_utc": 1586761203}, 
{"title": "thatsPRIMAL's Guide to playing and beating Mech Infiltrator", "author": "thatsPRIMAL", "selftext": "Hi! I'm  Riot thatsPRIMAL  and I'm Challenger Set 2 on NA, currently slumping in Masters Set 3. I recently left Riot to follow my dream of becoming a pro gamer: competing, streaming and making content. You can learn more about that, and see my past guides (including one to  egirls  which I called Girl Power) at [thatsPRIMAL.com]  I also stream most nights at 730pm PT at [twitch.tv/thatsPRIMAL]   I'm back with a guide to playing Mech Infiltrator on patch 10.7. I'll first  t by saying it's one of my least favorite comps to run as I don't find it very interesting or dynamic, but as arguably the strongest build, it's important that you know how to run it when you get a good  t!   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Core Principles**  * The Mech is strong because it baits front line  s into attacking it, and then has a large area of effect ultimate that can hit all of the  s targeting it. Utilize the best-in-class tanking ability of the Mech to draw aggro from front line enemy  s, allowing your low health but high damage Infiltrators to kill the exposed backline. It is critical that your mech stay alive long enough for the Infiltrators to do damage without getting focused themselves, which is why **the mech will be the priority for itemization**. * This build relies heavily on making 3    s (primarily Kaisa, Annie, Shaco, and Rumble) to win the game. As such, its greatest weakness is that if another person is also running the same build, it will be difficult to get your 3  s online and win. * This build spikes in power at level 6, at which point you can get 3 Mech Pilot synergy and 4 Infiltrator synergy. You will stay at level 6 until you at least get Kaisa 3, and likely until you get Kaisa 3 and Annie 3. Because Kaisa is likely to be 3 before Shaco and is easier to 3   (both because there are more Kaisas than Shacos, and because Shaco is sometimes used in other meta builds like 6 Dark  ), you will generally   to prioritize Kaisa items. * Commit to either winstreaking or lose streaking in stage 2 to accumulate enough gold to get to level 6 with 50 gold, and roll **only the interest you make off that 50 gold** as long as you can. You'll   to  t spending that principal and staying at 30-40 gold instead once you  t to be at risk of dying, or when you are very close (8 out of 9  s) to hitting a 3    .   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Strengths**  * Likely the strongest comp in the game once online Very straightforward to run when uncontested * Can easily exploit low hp ranged carries due to Infiltrator's ability to jump to the backline  **Weaknesses**  * Very item dependent - if your mech doesn't get tank items, you will have a hard time surviving late game. * If 1-2 other people are also trying to play this build, getting 3  s will be difficult. For this reason, scouting is essential. Do not run this if you are contested unless you are far ahead of the contestants in HP (ideally 30+) and have accumulated a good number of  s already (ideally have at least 2  s of everything). * Because you are only running 6-7  s all game, you are vulnerable to Zephyr and disables of any kind, as they are removing a higher percentage of your team than people running other compositions with a more standard leveling pattern.  **How to beat Mech Infiltrator**  * Zephyr is highly effective (even when the Mech has QSS) as there are fewer  s played in this comp thna others, making it easier to Zephyr a priority target. * Build Last Whisper - this item is critical for taking out the mech quickly enough to allow the rest of your team to refocus on the mech. * Positioning: This is probably the most reproducible counter to Mech Infiltrator: Place several melee carries or tanks on the backline like so, this will allow them to focus on the infiltrators instead of the mech. Make sure to keep at least one   on the front line to occupy the mech:    *   * Place a   with CC near the backline so that they CC the Infiltrators. See here for an example of how to do this with girl power:    *     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **When to play this:**  * You have an abundance of chains or swords, and it is not contested. * You have an abundance of chains and swords, it is contested, but you have an HP lead on the contestant  **Key Items (prioritize Mech, then Kaisa, then Shaco)**  * Mech    * Quicksilver Sash: Your Mech getting Zephyrd, Blitzcrank hooked, Wukong ulted, or otherwise disabled is the hardest counter to your comp because it often means that instead of your Mech getting focused, your Infiltrators, who are low health, will. There are ways that you can play around Zephyr (see positioning notes below), but QSS will protect you against unforeseen disables much more reliably than positioning will.    * Bramble Vest: A great item on your mech as it negates all bonus damage from critical hits, making it very difficult for most compositions to burst your mech down. The reflected damage is a nice bonus as well. Try to opt for this if you have an abundance of chain vests.    * Titan's Resolve (TR): Another good use of chain vest, and more typically what you'll end up building on your mech due to scarcity of chain vests. This works well on mech because the mech will quickly stack the TR as it draws aggro from most of the enemy team, allowing the mech to unlock TR's damage bonus when it finally ults. * Kaisa    * Demolitionist Spatula (Spatula+Rod): By far the most potent item on Kaisa as it allows her to stun the entire enemy backline, giving your infiltrators time to attack vulnerable carries. If you have a rod and don't need to use it immediately, try to hold out to get this item.    * Morellos: A good use of rod in most games, as you can't rely on getting spatula to make Kaisa a demolitionist. Works well because Kaisa can hit many different targets immediately, applying the Morellos burn to all of them.    * Seraphs: A great item on Kaisa when combined with her low mana pool, as it allows her to pump out damage. When coupled with Demolitionist Spatula, becomes insane as carries are rendered disabled for the majority of a fight. * Shaco    * Infinity Edge: Best in class damage item for Shaco because of the nature of his ult, which always crits.    * Bloodthirster: Shaco's ult activates lifesteal, allowing him to heal off the massive damage he does every time he ults. This, coupled with Shaco resetting aggro every time he ults, allows him to stay alive for a long time and kill multiple enemy carries.    * Guardian Angel: A good all around insurance policy for Shaco that will allow him to reliably get damage off, even in the face of multiple CC abilities.       * Note: I am not a big fan of putting this on the mech at the expense of other armor items because the role of the mech is to hold the aggro of the enemy's  s. While the mech is reviving from GA, they aren't holding aggro, diminishing the mech's effectiveness.  Also good:  * Infiltrator Spatula: Nowhere near as good as Demolitionist Spatula, but if you have a spare spatula and a bow, you can use this to make Kayle an Infiltrator, meaning you no longer need Khazix, and can accommodate Infiltrator and Sorcerer at level 7. * Deathcap/Jeweled Gauntlet: Decent items on Kaisa for raw damage output, especially when paired with Seraphs. Deathcap is much preferred, since sometimes you'll be running Valkyrie, making Jeweled Gauntlet somewhat redundant. * Ionic: A decent item on Kaisa because she jumps to the backline and causes carries to damage themselves when they ult. However, this uses cloak and rod, which are critical for QSS and Demolitionist/Morellos, respectively.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Level 7 Comp**  Most games you'll end at level 7 because you'll be prioritizing staying level 6-7 and rerolling to find 9 copies of Kaisa, Shaco, Annie, and Rumble.  * Ideal (2 Valkyrie, 4 Infiltrator, 3 Mech, 2 Sorcerer): Kayle/Miss Fortune (Infiltrator spatula), Fizz, Annie, Rumble, Shaco, Kaisa, Lux    * Lux is the best sorcerer without items because her ability isn't item dependent and can provide fight-changing CC. Avoid itemizing Lux, as her role will usually be to get one ult off and die. * Standard (2 Valkyrie, 4 Infiltrator, 3 Mech, 2 Sorcerer)) Kayle/MF    * Note: Kayle/MF are ideal if Kaisa is 3  red so you can get Valkyrie. However, until that point, you should run Lux for the added utility and most distributed damage buff (2 Sorcerer)    * Note: If you happen to get a 2   Ekko, you can replace Khazix with him  **What to prioritize on first carousel, in order of priority:**  1. Chain: Builds into Bramble (best), Titan's Resolve or GA. An early Bramble in particular will help prevent you from bleeding out midgame. 2. Sword: Builds into all 3 Shaco items: IE, BT, and GA 3. Glove: Builds into IE and QSS, which are core items for Shaco and the mech, respectively. Can also build Thief's glove on Kaisa or Shaco if you're struggling to get them items. 4. Rod: Builds into Kaisa items (Demolitionist Spatula, Morellos). I generally don't prioritize this on carousel as I find it is a less contested item in general an you don't really need more than one for the comp.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Stage by Stage breakdown:**  Early Game (Stage 1 and 2)  1. First you'll need to determine at 2-1 whether you think you'll be strong enough to win 5 rounds straight. If not, **you need to do your best to loss streak, and do so while losing minimal HP.** This is really counterintuitive for most players but optimal, as it will allow you to build up a huge cache of gold that you'll need to spend to find Fizz and 2   your infiltrators. Win streaking is definitely preferred, but harder to do and less reliable. While losing, collect Infiltrators. 2. Some great  s to loss streak with are Darius and Graves, as they will net you some extra gold from Space Pirates. 3. If you can make a bramble, make it - it can allow you to win rounds outright. Ionic is great on infiltrators since they generally get to carries, and then when the carries ult, they take damage. Bramble should go on a tank, like malphite, or a Vanguard. You can build this even while to loss streak, as it'll help you loss streak while losing a little less HP. Don't accidentally win though! 4. Make sure to go to level 5 to beat Krugs. If you are level 4 but have 3 upgraded  s, you likely will not have to level up to beat Krugs.  Mid Game (Stage 3)  1. SCOUT! If you see too many other Mech Infiltrator players, you may need to pivot to something like a Jhin Vanguard or Dark   comp, which can utilize the chains and swords well too. In my opinion, no more than 2 people can get mech infiltrator. This is the really skillful part of the game, and games are won or lost by the decision you make.    1. Whether those players look like they actually plan on holding Kaisa and Shaco, or are just playing them for a little while as they pursue another comp.    2. Do you have enough gold to pursue 3  s? If you rolled down at 3-2 and still don't have at least Shaco and Kaisa 2, you probably need to pivot. 2. Note: You   to **stop lose streaking here** and  t to stabilize, otherwise you'll lose too much health to survive long enough to get your 3   powerspike. Play your strongest board! 3. Hopefully you are 40-50 gold and 60-70 hp at 3-1. You should stay at level 5 until you can go to level 6 without dipping below your 50 gold principal, **unless you are below 60 hp**. In which case you should go to 6 and roll down ASAP. 4. As soon as you reach 6,  t spending your interest above 50 to accumulate Annies, Kaisas, Shacos and Rumbles. Note: because of the amount of rolling you're going to be at 6, you'll likely find a Fizz at some point, so do not level up to 7 until you have at least one of your 3  s (like Annie or Kaisa).  Mid-Late (Stage 4)  1. During this stage, it is important that you get Fizz and get QSS - so  t to roll more aggressively, dipping below 50 gold, if needed. It may even be worth picking up Fizz on carousel if you don't already have one. 2. You should also be close (7-8 out of 9  s) to hitting 3  s, so feel free to roll aggressively. 3. Once you have Kaisa 3, go to 7 and throw in a Valkyrie so that you aren't at a numerical disadvantage from having 6  s on the board.  Late Game:  1. Focus primarily on positioning here! Kaisa should be in the middle and either one hex to the right or left depending on who she  s to focus. Shaco should be more far right or left depending on where the carry is. MF/Kayle should be cornered so their ults hit as many people as possible. Continue roling at 7 to complete your remaining 3  s.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Win (1st places) Conditions:**  1. At least three 3  red  s with ideal items on at least 2 of them. 2. Perfect mech items and 3   Shaco and Kaisa   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Positioning:**  1. Versus most comps:   2. Versus most comps when you don't have QSS: place Khazix in front to tank Zephyr:   3. Versus teams that are clumped in a corner:", "id": "g09utb", "num_comments": 66, "created_utc": 1586744328}, 
{"title": "Sun Astronaut's Guide - Revisiting Protectors", "author": "SunAstronaut", "selftext": "Hello all, I'm Sun Astronaut a S2 Challenger, and currently (but who knows for how long) S3 Challenger, and a protector enthusiast. I've been asked a lot in smaller twitch channel's chats questions about protectors so I thought I'd just write a \"revisiting guide\" on them. There's already been a protector guide I think written in 10.6 by HiddenDino, but obviously with meta shifts the way a build is played gets changed. I'm here to talk about in what cases I'd consider forcing it or playing it and what should be done in late game.      Challenger Proof and proof I'm Sun Astronaut:         # Core  s  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Xin Zhao, Sona, J4, Rakan, Neeko the rest will be described at the late game portion of the guide.      # Early Game  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So you  t the game and after the first couple of creep rounds you've noticed you have a bunch of defensive items. Maybe 1 chain, 1 cloak, 1 tear, 1 rod. A normal person looks at this and says this is a great Mech Infil game! You have half a titans/bramble, half a qss, half a seraphs, and half a demo spat/morello. Well you're a chad gamer who isn't trying to hold hands and go 7   8, so you scout the lobby and see there is no one playing protectors. So you decide to play them! Usually here I'll open fort, and only consider losing econ for Xin Zhao. (Even then I'm more likely to lock a shop with xin zhao to hit econ points then lose econ since econ snow balls). Your priority now is to make sure you make a bramble for Xin.      **Important things to note:**      I will almost always open fort because getting bramble is way too important. If you don't get bramble you're going top 8 like 90% of the time. You can only play your strongest board if you already got a bramble naturally from first round of creeps. Even then it is risky because you really need strong econ in a re-roll comp, so it's much easier to manage a lose streak than a win streak.  Lose streaking in protectors is a lot less risky than something like infil mech or Bangbros since you stabilize as soon as you hit xin 2 with bramble and since you're rolling at 5 that happens way earlier than other reroll comps.  Also leveling to 5 might be needed to beat krugs/terrabursters, and that's okay beating that is more important than losing 2 rounds at level 5.      # Mid Game  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I consider mid game everything from after krugs/terrabursters to round 4-3 (The rolldown round for fast 8ers). Here you will slow roll (excess 50) all your gold until 4-3. Your goal is obviously to hit Rakan 3, Xin 3, J4 3, Sona 3. You will not be looking to get Neeko 3 99% of the time, unless the game is shoving them down your throats and that's because those dirty SG players will be contesting your neekos.  For positioning in mid game usually I'll have neeko in front of most their front line to cc/damage all of them. You   xin zhao to be on the side with their highest physical damage carries because of bramble. You   to position sona in the back and rakan with the best position to hit their mid/backline after front line gets taken down. At 4-3 or 4-5 (Depending on whether or not you had to level to beat krugs) you'll usually roll down to like 20 gold to try and hit everything 3  . Important to note if you're not close to sona and J4 you can ignore them, ONLY XIN and RAKAN MUST BE 3 red. Obviously if you're at 1 or 2 lives you just roll down all your gold to hit both Xin 3 and Rakan 3 because you have to stabilize.      For items here's a list of what you   with the corresponding  :  Xin Zhao - BIS: Bramble (MUST), Titan's Resolve, D Claw; Other options: QSS, Frozen heart, Another bramble  Rakan - BIS: Morello (MUST), Shojin, Any AP Item; Other options: Bramble, QSS, HOJ, Seraphs, Bramble  J4 - BIS: Thieves gloves; Other options: All your other AD Tank items  Sona - BIS: Nothing unless you have components for trap claw (Trap claw is good cause kaisas will jump back ult and stun herself): Other options: AP/Mana items that don't fit on Rakan      # Late Game Options  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So you got this far into the guide congrats for being able to read my shitty C student level English. But what you   to learn about is how to play the late game. So there was a small one liner which explained the core 5  s for this comp. From here the build is a lot more flexible than jamming 4 mystics like it used to be.  So the 6th most common   is Karma to get mystic. For level 6 it's always going to be a mystic. With 2 mystic getting a buff this patch and 4 mystic getting a nerf staying on 2 mystic will be very common. It can be either Karma or Raka most likely unless you get a Lulu on carousel.  From here it gets interesting. At level 7 the most common shove is a Jhin. Jhin 1 even with no items cranks out a lot of damage when it has a strong front line like the protector front line. You can even tether Karma to make jhin do even more damage. You'll only be shoving Jhin if you have Karma as your 2nd mystic, or some how have a dark  spat.  Another choice is to get 4 celestial at 7 if you some how get a lulu at 7 or celestial spat. 4 celestial is actually a tank stat to an extent since your xin zhao and rakan will be putting out decent damage and healing up from it. Celestial 4 is equivelent to celestial 2 when you're getting morollo'd or red buff'd.  If you get a   guardian spat somewhere, you can slap it on Sona, and play 3  guardian at 6 with 2 mystic by playing soraka.  So somehow the game got to you getting level 8/9, and I've noticed most protector players tunnel way too hard into getting 4 mystics every game. However with how the meta has shifted most time 4 mystics is really not needed. (You should still hold the parts for 4 mystics incase top 4 has SG players). What I like to do a lot of times is shove in 4 celestial. Sometimes if I get enough celestial spats I'll try to play 6 celestial as Ashe and Kassadin are just both really good  s, which isn't including Lulu. You could also play 4 celestial 2 sniper 3 dark   at 9 by playing both Ashe and Jhin and another random celestial or at 8 if you have a celestial spat. You could also just shove in both MF and Kayle because they're just good  s if you some how hit both and get to 9. Obviously even at the end of this 4 mystic is still not bad, because many comps still do have some magic damage whether it be SG or MF/Kayles in their comps.      # Ending Notes  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That concludes my Protector guide. Props to you if you actually got this far. If you have questions, I'll try to answer any on the bottom. Also I'm always down to get critiqued on my guide style if it isn't good. (I dunno I might not even write another guide ever, I'm lazy AF) Also I'm always down to hear input from other people as theorycrafting in this game is one of my favorite things to do. Also you can always catch me \"modding\" Kiyoon's chat, and trolling around in Kurumx, Marwins chats as well, come say Hi", "id": "g01y8z", "num_comments": 53, "created_utc": 1586716090},

I recently wrote the [Guide to Intermediate Concepts]  I've been really liking the egirl comp so I  ed to share how I approach the build.  You can see a some example games here: [lolchess - Main]  and [lolchess - Smurf]   I also stream regularly at   so you can watch me play the build there and ask me questions.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **TLDR**  * Play a strong early board that'll get you to level 7 efficiently. Once you hit level 7 with 50+ gold (usually by 4-1 or earlier) , roll excess gold every round until you 3 * Neeko   Syndra   Ahri    Lux. After you hit your  s (can forego Ahri and Lux if you're not close) go 8 and play Lulu.  * **Ideal Syndra items** are Double Seraphs + Trap Claw. If you can't hit those: GA can replace Trap Claw and Deathcap can replace 2nd Seraphs. * **Ideal Neeko items** are full tank: Bramblevest/DClaw/Ionic Spark/Titan's Resolve. If you can't hit those, most tank items can work: QSS, Warmogs, GA, Trap Claw. * **Don't play this comp if it's contested.** If contested, the highroller will go 4th at best and the lowroller with go 7-8th. There are not enough Syndras and Neekos for two people to hit 3 *.   [Positioning: Neeko solo in the front; Poppy in front if Neeko doesn't have QSS, otherwise she's zephyr /blitz bait; Ahri in the 3rd row center-ish; rest in the back.]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **When to play this comp**  1.

This comp can even beat mechs with proper positioning (but will ultimately depend on items).    * **Positioning is relatively easy.** You can keep your standard positioning vs most comps.     * **Linear build after stage 3.** Once you get 6SG at level 7 you're basically just mindlessly rolling for upgrades.     * **Satisfying fights.** Unkillable Neeko CC's half the enemy team while your Syndra one shots everybody. * **Cons**    * **Item dependent.** You need at least one Seraphs and Trap Claw/GA on Syndra, and you need tank items for Neeko. You'll struggle if your items are bad.    * **Will bottom4 if contested.** This isn't a comp that you   to play holding hands. There aren't enough 3costs in the pool for two players, and even if you hit a 3 * you'll likely have spent more money and taken more damage before you hit it. That means...    * **You can't force this every game.** You will inevitably encounter players who get a better egirl  t than you and don't   to pivot. Or maybe they just won't mind holding hands to bottom4. Or maybe you just didn't hit any tears. In these case you should probably pivot so that you don't lose that previous LP. Even if the other player plays it poorly and dies faster than you, they'll have griefed you hard enough that you'll end up 4th-6th.    * **Struggles vs Jhin.** This comp has a weak frontline so Jhin will get through it quickly and then proceed to oneshot all your egirls. Trap Claw does nothing vs Jhin.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Items**  * **Carousel:** Tear     Rod   Armor   Glove    * Rod and armor allow you to play flexibly in case you decide not to commit SG. Rod is obviously useful in a Sorc comp no matter what, and Neeko  s the armor.    * Glove is a Trap Claw component, but you can also slam a Thief's Gloves on Ahri if you get her early. This can keep you healthy as you wait for lvl7. * **Syndra**    * **Seraphs**  - Syndra's ults increase in power each time she ults so Seraphs gets her ramped up faster.    * **Trap Claw**  - Negates Irelia damage and stuns her for 4 seconds. Also helps stop MF and Velkoz channels, and keeps Syndra alive against the notorious Bang Bros.    * **Deathcap**  - the best damage option if you don't have a second Seraphs. Prioritize Neeko items before this though.    * **GA**  - can work in place of Trap Claw but doesn't feel as good. Irelia will kill Syndra, Syndra will revive, and Irelia will just kill her again. Trap Claw stuns Irelia so your team can kill her.    * **Gunblade**  - it's an OK option if you have a useless sword and nothing else to build. Can help Syndra heal but usually if she's being attacked by a carry without Trap Claw she'll just die anyways. * **Neeko**    * You just   defensive items on her. Ideally **Bramblevest,** **Dragon's Claw, and Titan's Resolve/Ionic Spark.**     * **Other items that work well:**        * **GA**  - helps her get her ult off if you don't have other tank items       * **QSS**  - she's your only frontline so QSS prevents any Zephyr shenanigans       * **Trap Claw**        * **Morello** * **Spatula**    * **  Guardian Spat**  - With this you can go 6 Sorc 6 SG at 8 by playing Velkoz and Annie. SG Spat can go on Lux if you hit her 3 * or you can place it on Velkoz if not.        * SG Spat on Velkoz is hit or miss cause he's *not* mana locked during his ult so if he reaches full mana from SG + taking damage then he'll  t his ult over. This can be good if he's hitting a key target but bad if he's just whiffing.    * **Celestial Spat**  - If you don't have an extra tear, you can make this so that you have Celestial at lvl 8 when you play Lulu or Rakan. * Throw other items on Lux/Ahri based on who you 3 *.  * Lategame get extra mana items for Lulu.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Leveling/Econ Strategy**  * This comp doesn't come online until level 7 so the goal is to econ hard to level 7 while playing a strong board to maintain relatively high HP. Once you  t hitting your  s at level 7 you'll  t winstreaking. * If you need more tears, you can purposely losestreak until stage 2 carousel.  * Otherwise try to get to 50g as fast as possible while maintaining a strong-ish board. The only time I would force a lose streak is during stage 2. Can't take too much damage or you won't have enough time to slowroll. * Once at 50g, pump all excess gold into levels until you're level 7. Once you're level 7, roll all excess gold to look for Neeko, Syndra, Ahri, and Lux. Don't waste bench space 3 *ing Poppy and Zoe.  **Early Game Examples (Stage 2)**      [TF holds Syndra items. He can do good damage and Chrono2 gets lots of value early on. Zoe in place of Ahri if you don't have Ahri. Ahri on row2 or 3 so she can hit the enemy backline with her ult.]       [Not as ideal cause you'll have to hold Ahris /Zoes on bench but it's strong. Also lets you pivot to mechs if you  . Can replace vanguards with brawlers.]       [The get-rich-quick scheme. It's not as strong as the others but can net you a lot of gold. More econ = faster level 7. If you hit Jayce, run him instead of Darius, and put in Poppy since she's part of your final comp.]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Mid Game (Stage 3)**  * You can continue using your stage 2 carries but  t sprinkling in your Sorcs or Neeko. * Alternatively you can play stronger carries that the game gives you. For example, Morde2 or Lucian2 can carry stage 3 really well. * Don't roll at all; put all excess gold above 50 into levels. Level to 6 at 8/20exp unless you're confident in your board strength. * If you're losing hard and dropping low on HP  ~50, roll a bit at 6 to stabilize (2 * carries/frontline), but don't roll all the way down.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Mid-Late Game (Stage 4) and Late Game (Stage 5+)**  * Hit level 7 by 4-1 at latest and roll excess gold above 50 every turn. * Hit your 3  s :) * I usually all-in once I'm at  ~30ish hp so that I can stabilize and maintain 2-3 lives.  * Go 8 once you hit your 3 *s and play Lulu.

{"title": "How To Dominate Low Elo and Abuse Shaco with Dark  ", "author": "Mental-Association", "selftext": "A bit of backstory about me, I'm a mediocre League player at best, but I consider myself to be a decent TFT player. I've been playing since the beta on PBE. When TFT was officially out, I got to Diamond. Ranked anxiety kicked in, also there were shit rewards, so I had no incentive to continue climbing. I consider season 2 to be shit, I was not a fan of the elemental hexes that forced you to position like a retard so I have about 20 games on season 2.   Currently I'm Plat and I refuse to play ranked for one simple reason - Shaco is completely broken and whenever I try to play the game normally, there's someone who abuses Shaco in my lobby and whipe his ass with my face so I decided to abuse Shaco better than the abusers... at least until next patch when 8 Sorcerers is online.   If you manage to get the perfect item Shaco, you get top 2 average. If you're missing an item or two, get at least top 4, and I'd even go as far to say you can get top 4 without items on Shaco but I haven't tested this yet.   **ITEMS**  The perfect Shaco items are:   1. Guardian Angel 2. Bloodthirster 3. Infinity Edge  In that order.   * Guardian Angel - if he dies to something, he can come back, stronger, because by the time he revives, other Dark    s would die, making him stronger.  * Bloodthirster - Goes off from his ability. He's always gonna be full HP after he blinks.  * Infinity Edge - Just... oneshots tanks.  If you can't get these items and/or you're extremely unlucky, anything with BF and/or Crit Glove works.  Every item that has a BF Sword component is OK on Shaco, except Zekes and BOTRK.   * Gunblade is the next best thing if you can't get Bloodthrister. * Giant Slayer is an okay replacement for IE. * Spear of Shojin is okay, especially if you don't have GA, but you do have a Bloodhtirster. * Deathblade is another good replacement for IE.   Now let's say you got the Crit Glove but you didn't find a BF Sword. What do you do with it? Just slap it on Shaco and call it a day, it's gonna be good enough. That crit is gonna go a long way. In case you have extra items, every item you're gonna make on Shaco is gonna be good, unless it's Dark  's Heart and Thief's Gloves. Everything else is okay.   * Hand of Justice is good, especially if you didn't get BT. * Trap Claw is good because blocks one CC and stuns. Why the fuck not.  * Quicksilver is good because blocks most CC.  * Last Whisper is the next best thing if you didn't get a BF sword for IE.  * Jeweled Gauntlet doesn't really help much, you're better off giving the Rod to Lux.  * Shroud of Stillness... I have no idea, I've been avoiding this item like the COVID-19. Might be good for something. Can't hurt since it gives crit.  Whatever else items you get you just throw on different  s. If you get:  * Tank items - Throw them on Morde and/or Jarvan. Stack one of them so Yasuos can ult your tanks instead of Shacos and Luxes. * AP items - chuk em on Lux. If Lux is full - Karma.  * Attack Speed items - Again, Lux. Especially if you get Static. It helps with her ults.  * Other Damage items - You may be lucky and get a few extra swords - throw em' on Jhin for good measure so Jhin too can hit like a truck.   ** S AND SYNERGIES**  There's a reason why I  ted with the items first, and not the  s. They literally don't matter, as long as you have Dark  ... It doesn't even have to be Dark   6. 3 is also fine... might be a bit hard to believe, but I've been without a Jarvan 2 right up until I was top 2, since one other player was stacking Protector and couldn't get a J4, so I didn't put J4 in because I had 2 Morde 2s. The build worked fine with 5 Dark  s since I had hyperstacked Shaco.   Let's  t with the  s, in case you don't know the Dark  :  * Jarvan * Morde * **Lux** * **Karma** * **Shaco** * Jhin * Xerath (10.8)  Notice how I bolded Lux, Karma and Shaco? That's because they're 3 cost and we'll get back to this in the later chapter.   Other possible synergies you can get are:  * Sniper * Sorcerer * Infiltrator  Sniper so you give more damage to Jhin. Sorcerer for Lux. **Infiltrator for Shaco**, which, in my opinion is the best thing to have for this strategy. It literally can be ANY infiltrator because the other  s literally don't matter. If I see an Ekko in the shop, I put it in for shits and giggles. MOST OF MY GAMES I DON'T EVEN PUT AN EXTRA   THAT'S NOT DARK   and I can't stress this enough. Whatever I can get to 2  s, I put on the board. Whatever I don't have 2  s, I keep on the bench. Most of the time I win with just 6 Dark   and nothing more. Although, if you really   to tryhard, get an infiltrator 2 and play it.   **ECON AND PLAYSTYLE**  Now for the actual guide. First thing you need to do is get try your best to get a BF Sword. Be prepared not to get a BF Sword and look for alternatives before you're allowed to make an item. If there are no BF Swords, Crit Glove should be your next priority, and Chain Vest after that. BF Sword is the best thing to get on the first carousel since you're gonna need 3 of them.  If it's Neekoverse, instructions come in later. If it's lilac nebula, ignore the  s, get BF Sword. If it's Fat Legends, you int harder. Speaking of INT..   Right from the  t, just after the mob rounds, you  t inting. Spread your  s as much as you can so you can  t losing. You're gonna have to int up to the point you get 3 BF Swords or you're gonna int until 4-4, since you usually get completed items on that carousel.   After the mob rounds, you  t inting and prepare for econ, but whatever Dark     you see in the shop, you take it. It's okay if you don't get any Dark    s at this point too, but if you do, put them on the board and sell whatever else you have. By this point, you should only have Dark    s and Econ. Do not put any items on  s yet. Second Carousel - same thing as the first, but this time, since you inted, you should be first pick, so you have your second BF Sword. Keep inting and keep taking whatever Dark   you can take.   Whatever excess gold above 50 you have, you spend on level. Somewhere after the 3rd carousel, you should have enough gold to get level 7, with having 50+ gold. It should happen around the jumping alien mobs on 3-7.  **When you get level 7, you stop leveling.** Why Level 7? Because at Level 7, you have 40% chance to hit a 3 cost  , the maximum in the game. This is where you get Lux, Karma and Shaco.   Once you get your final drops, cash or items, ** T ROLLING LIKE A MANIAC!**   Get every Dark     from the shop, then get every 3 cost in the shop (careful not to combine the 3 cost into 2  ), then reroll. Again. Get every Dark  , 3 cost, roll. Win or lose, it doesn't matter, but right as the round is about to end, sell every 3 cost that you bought that's not a Dark   at the end of the round so you get some econ back. Next round - do the same. Get Dark  , 3 cost, reroll. Do this until you reach 0 gold. Once you reach 0 gold, then put your items on Shaco. At this point, you should have Shaco 2 with perfect items and now you  t to win, with 7 Dark   on the field. Whatever extra gold you get, you use it to roll and look for Lux, Karma and Shaco. If you rerolled and you find Shaco, sell one Lux or Karma to get it. Shaco has top priority. Rolling it down to 0 at this level also gives you access to some 4 cost  s. You should  t seeing Jhin in the shop, unless you're incredibly unlucky and by now you should have all Dark   with your perfect items Shaco 2. Keep looking for Shaco for the rest of the game. Even if people are going for Shaco, you should be able to find enough Shacos to make a Shaco 2.   If you   to really tryhard, at about 5-4,  t looking around for players that have Shaco and make mental notes when they die.  t holding gold from your win streaks, be ready to roll it down again when a player with Shaco dies. Once you get Shaco 3, you can go AFK, grab a snack, something to drink, put on a show because you're all set.   **CONCLUSION**  The reason why this works is because:  * You cycle through the 3 cost  s and roll down at a point in the game when no one else really rolls down as you do. * People usually are rolling down for 4 cost, not 3 cost, so you get most Dark    s and you make the other Dark   players weaker.  * Shaco is broken. With the right items.   Only a few things that beat this Shaco are:  * Stacked Xin (but I've seen Shaco win those). * Batman. * Perfect items Vel'Koz. * Hyper CC comps that run several Wukongs and Lulus.  * GP + Rumble and/or Ziggy (but I've seen Shaco win those).    If you follow this to the letter, even with no luck, you should consistently be getting at least 4th. You should be fine to gold. You'd have to pay more attention to the rest of the players in plat+ so you can position your infiltrators to go for their carries.   Why am I bringing this to everyone's attention? Because I've seen the next patch notes and there's no nerf for Shaco. I hope enough people are gonna  t doing this for Riot to see how broken Shaco is. Shaco is actually a pretty decent  , but I feel like he should cost more. I would be fine if one or two people have Shaco 2, but I'm not fine with 4 people in lobby going for Shaco. Making Shaco into a 4 cost would be an excellent nerf. I feel like it's too easy to get Shaco 3 and win the game.  I'm gonna  t using this guide and I'm gonna play like this every single game just to see how high I can climb and maybe post an update.   Thanks if you read so far. Have fun collecting Shacos and be on a lookout for Batman.", "id": "fyhd5e", "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1586530777}, 
{"title": "Very Fun and Unique Vanguard/Mystic/Dark   Build", "author": "Sogeking33", "selftext": "Here is the build:    So I  ed to make a build that centered around Morde because I think he's a pretty cool  . That's the thought process around the build, he's your carry (along with Shaco later) and your synergies and  s are there to support him. Vanguard wasn't enough for Morde because right when you go against a sorcerer late game he still gets blown up (regardless of dragon's claw). So you need mystic to fill in the holes. It is a level 8 build minimum but level 9 ideally.   **Econ Strat:** You   to focus on getting space pirates early - preferably Jayce since he's one of your vanguards in order to get your econ rolling. You can run whatever you   with it till we get the necessary  s to transition around level 6-7. Don't roll at all until you hit level 6. Once you're lvl 6 with 50 gold roll down to 50 each round till you get a bunch of our 2 and 3 cost  s to lvl 2 in order to transition into the main build. Keep space pirates around for awhile until you can get 3 dark  .   **Synergies:** Our synergy order throughout the game should loosely follow this: Space pirates early for gold  Vanguard=Dark     Mystic. You can roll with 2 vanguards 2 space pirates 3 dark   for example until you get your Wukong for 4 vanguards. Ignore mystic completely until 7 (potentially) if you are able to get a Soraka 2 then you can replace space pirates for 2 mystic. If you can't get a Soraka 2 around 7 then keep in the space pirates and continue rolling for 3 *. Once the 3 * are out of the way we're gunna get to 8 and look for Lulu ASAP for 4 mystics. 4 mystics and 3 dark   is only possible at 9 so your priority is dependent on what your opponents have. Run 3 dark   if there aren't many Sorcs or run 4 mystic if there are. Once you're lvl 8 with this build it'll be close to over. You'll be extremely strong either way but get to 9 if possible to get 3 dark   and 4 mystic.  **3*   priority:** Morde Karma=Shaco. I have a bias towards Karma but you should be looking for them both. Because this comp relies on low cost 3* to thrive we   to do the majority of our rolling at 6, but if the losses  t rolling in we can level up and  t rolling at 7 as well. 2 costs have a higher chance at lvl 6 (morde) but 3 costs have a higher chance at lvl 7 (shaco/karma) so it's not a big deal if you have to lvl to 7 early to stay in the game. But if you are able to get a morde 3* first then shift your priority to getting lvl 8 ASAP for the 4 mystics (you can look for your remaining 3 cost 3* at lvl 8 since they still have a fairly high chance to appear).  **Items:** Item priority is Morde Karma Shaco=Soraka. The biggest thing is of course Morde's items. This is where your skill as a player comes in. You can't brainlessly get the same 3 items every game. You have to adapt to your opponents. The only staple item in my opinion is Dragon's Claw. It helps early on when we lack our mystic buff and is helpful in all situations for survival. After that we have a few options: Ionic Spark, Morellos, Warmogs, Bramble Vest, Titan's resolve and Hextech. I like Ionic Spark and Morellos a lot on him. Ionic Spark is going to trigger a lot because of his survivability so it's a great pick. Morellos helps you apply the damage and healing debuffs. It pairs well with Warmogs since it has HP on it. Bramble is a good pick when there are a lot of physical teams and Titan's resolve is a good option if there's a mix of physical/magic teams (and also one of my favorites) because of his survivability. Hextech I haven't played around with much because a lot of people run healing debuff items such as their own morellos or red buff but it has potential if those items aren't present. Karma and Soraka's items should be Shojins. Shacos items are standard Shaco items (IE, BT, GA). There's very little overlap between Morde's potential items and the other 3  s which is nice. For the little overlap there is.. make sure you don't waste any item combinations on them before Morde. Morde takes absolutely priority.  A few last thoughts - always put Karma on Morde and put Karma in the back (unless a lot of infiltrators). Poppy can be swapped out for Leona if you get more Leonas. Make items early and put them on your non Jayce Space pirate to build up your best chance at a win streak since we'll be selling him later anyways. If you get an early Shaco 3 before Morde or Karma you can shift your item priority to him for a bit until you reach Morde 3. Lastly, this build is quite the process and takes awhile to achieve. There are levels to it and power spikes but the more you play it the more you'll get the hang of it. It has outlasted and convincingly beat the very meta full 3* protector Xin build. I think it's a bit of a hidden gem tbh. Curious to see how others do with it. Enjoy!", "id": "fxm4ct", "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1586407944},

{"title": "Challenger Guide to General Improvement/tips", "author": "Bulls0717", "selftext": "Hey Guys, I'm Bulls0717 (  and I am a set 2 and 3 challenger player who at the time of posting this is rank #21 in NA. I  ed to make a post talking about how I personally have improved as a player and some general tips for other players. This is by no means a complete guide and just something I threw together quickly.      In my opinion the best way to improve is by watching other people play. I suggest watching top-ranked players streams' and asking yourself  what play would I make here? , if the streamer makes a different play ask yourself  why did the streamer make that play? . If you can't understand what made their play more optimal than yours, asking in chat for them to explain their thought process will help you to fully understand why they made the play they did. Most streamers will be glad to explain their thought process as to why they made the play they did. I find doing this useful because you can think about the optimal play without having to worry about scouting or the stress of losing as well as learning what a top player would do in different situations. Implementing their decision-making process into your own games can help you to improve drastically faster than just playing the game. I say this because in every game I've ever played I've found it hard to improve by playing against people that are at or below my skill level, by seeing high skill level players play and comparing your decision making process to theirs you will learn much more than you can by playing the game.          While watching Streamers you should also be focusing on what  s they value and why, knowing what  s to value early game over others allows you to either win streak or have an easier time transitioning into a late-game comp.          I'm not personally a fan of rewatching my own games as I can usually identify my mistakes right after I make them. I also don't like rewatching my games because of the fact that my thought process will likely be the exact same, If I've learned nothing new since playing the game I likely won't see what I did wrong. However, I think going through a checklist of possible mistakes after each game can help. Ask yourself things like  could I have preserved more health in the early game ,  did I scout to see if people were contesting me ,  could I have pivoted to another comp ,  was my positioning incorrect ,  or how often did I scout . If you're tilted after playing a game take a short break to think over what went wrong. There are some games where you will lose purely because of rng but it's important to remember that while rng exists in a single game across 1  games rng is not much of a factor.      Plan ahead during rounds. Knowing what your plan is for the next turn can help tremendously. Taking an extra turn than you need to in order to complete a pivot or do a roll down can turn a top 4 into a bottom 4 very quickly. By planning out as far as you can, you are able to use your time between rounds to improve your board instead of thinking about what you should be doing. You can also use the time during rounds to continue scouting. Always keep your brain thinking about what you should be doing. Many top players are known for randomly moving things on their bench in tft or in other games like CSGO people will randomly shake their crosshair to keep their brain focused and active. Keeping your brain actively thinking will help you to avoid situations where you take too long to make decisions and perform better in-game.          I'd also like to talk about scouting as I think a lot of players know that they should scout but don't know what they should actually be looking for while scouting. During the early game you should be scouting to map out in your head what comp each person in your game is planning on going. This is especially important in this patch where playing an uncontested comp is very important. If mech infiltrators or   guardians are uncontested, with the way player damage is currently set up where players almost all live until stage 6 you WILL hit eventually. It's only a matter of time until you hit if you're uncontested and can lead to a free top 4. You should also be focused on seeing the general power level of other players in the lobby. If you won the round on 2-1 you should be asking yourself if you can force a win streak by leveling for 2-2 or not. Scouting during the mid-game should be similar to the early game. Scout to see how contested your comp is and if you need to be pivoting or not. See if people are running a heavy ad or ap comps. If there are lots of people playing ad carries with ie consider looking to build a bramble. For the late game you should be focused primarily on positioning as well as denying  s. Scout for anything that you can counter through positioning. Zephyrs are the most obvious thing to be looking for but things like infiltrators can also be partially countered through proper positioning. Denying  s can be huge during the late game. Scout to see if people are close to 3  ring their important  s. For example, if someone has 7 irelias and you have extra gold, hold irelia to deny them from 3  ring it.      Hopefully this can help some people out and thanks for reading :)  If you have any questions feel free to ask, this is my first time making a guide and If there are any specific comps you would like a guide on let me know.", "id": "fwrlfw", "num_comments": 23, "created_utc": 1586289929}, 
{"title": "Item pool explination (Information from Mort)", "author": "Royklein12", "selftext": "Hey, so I was watching a Mort vid and he explained in it how the item pool works, and I thought it's something most of us here would   to know so I wrote up this small explination.  **How it works**  Each player has a bag that  ts with 2 of each item. Any time you get items from neutral drops it pulls from the bag. After Every carousel round you get 1 more of each item added to the bag. Carousel items dont count against your bag cuz they arent taken out of it. I am unsure if pirates pull from bag or not. So you can't get more than 2 of the same items from the first PvE rounds, and you get a higher chance of getting items you havn't gotten.   **How this changes decision making**  If there are 2 item components you   form carousel and you're unsure which one to go for, you should go for the one you haven't gotten as much from drops for better odds.  EG: Say you have a tear, a seraphs, and a sword, and you   GA and (2nd)Seraphs but unsure which to go for in carousel. If you got the tears from neutral drops you should go for tear in carousel because you have a higher chance of getting vest from drops later on due to having less tears in your bag.    Hopefully this helps you with your decision making with items, and GL in your climb.   **TL;DR:** If you get a component from neutral drop you have a lower chance of getting it again and the chances increase(ish~) over the course of the game   [Source", "id": "fwh6au", "num_comments": 56, "created_utc": 1586249884}, 
{"title": "Detailed Guide on How To Improve", "author": "Bhavya0409", "selftext": "Hey everyone! I noticed that there are guides here every day on how to play certain builds, but not a single guide on how to actually improve your own gameplay, and that kinda sucks. It's important to know what you did wrong and how you can improve, so I  ed to make a guide that can show you what you can do to work on yourself, by yourself. One more thing to note is that I don't like to force comps, unless I'm giving perfect items early. I generally play my best board until I find a carry   that can use my items effectively, and make a comp out of that (so I usually don't go for 6 piece synergies or hyperroll/slowroll comps unless the items/ s early game are perfect), so this guide is for people that like to play flexibly. For reference, I'm only D4, but I play against high diamond players with good placements, and am aiming for at least GM this set. My profile is here    There's only 1 real secret to getting better: **Stream for yourself, rewatch the vods after every game, and critically analyze every single play you make**. If you   to click away, you can do so now, since this entire guide will circle this 1 core principle. If you're not yet convinced, please keep reading.  **Benefits**  1. You know your tendencies better than anyone else. Hiring a challenger player to watch your vods and find our your mistakes is the same thing as you doing it yourself; the only difference is that it will take more time since you don't know even know what mistakes your making. Maybe you get an armor, belt, and a bow and, after playing nothing but rebels for a while, you think \"damn these items suck, I can't jam anything\". If you take the time out to think of possible other options, you'll see that you have a perfect  ts to blasters (Red buff + GS component).  2. You have the luxury of time to think. Like I mentioned, being able to rewatch the vods will give you as much time as you need to think of other routes to take. This is especially true when rolling down for upgrades. Usually you're so fixated on certain  s for a comp that you don't realize that you passed on a potential pivot (i.e. playing cyber/blades mid game looking for Irelia, but over the course of rolling down 30-40 gold, you missed out on a potential Kayle2). This stuff can be easily found if you spent more time during each roll, which is hard in game, but easy afterwards.  3. There's no pressure when watching a video. In a game, you have to make usually crucial game deciding decisions in 30 seconds. To novice players, that is very daunting, and hearing the clock wind down the last 3 seconds can be scary if you're board isn't already ready to go, leaving you prone to make mistakes. But when watching a vod, you'll look back and think, \"WTF I was an idiot, I needed to put my kayle in the corner since I have RFC QSS\"  4. You learn A LOT more on potential pivots, item combinations, synergies, small nuances, etc. As you  t watching more and more, you'll pick up on certain tendencies for  s, like targetting, item synergies, etc. You'll also learn about how to play better given what you're dealt, which is what the game should be about (yeah, I'm looking at you guys that say \"me mech, me no scout, if someone contests we both bottom4\"  :( )  5. You can pay more attention to supporting  s and try to optimize positioning. I'm not sure if anyone else does this, but I personally love waiting to watch my Kayle crit the entire enemy team, but in doing so, I completely miss that my wukong was focused and never got his ult off. When you rewatch the vods, you can pick out mistakes like this, and remember to focus on making sure every   is the strongest it can be at every stage in the game.  There are much more positives, but I'll leave you to find them yourself :)  **Questions To Ask Yourself**  As you're watching, there should also be a goal in mind when improving. It's not enough to just watch a vod, but you have to CRITICALLY ANALYZE EVERY SINGLE PLAY YOU MAKE. During the early game, where your entire comp direction can change basically every shop, it's not uncommon for me to spend 4-5 minutes on every round in stage 2 to see what the most optimal play is at that certain moment. I usually do this by asking myself certain core questions as the game progresses to make sure I'm getting the most bang for my buck. (Again, this is usually not possible in game since you only have 30 seconds, so this is where watching vods really shines)  When asking your own questions, don't ask boolean questions. Ask open ended questions. The whole goal is to get you to think of every possible route to take, and slowly whittle down the choices until you have 1 left (which should be the best one). For example, instead of asking \"Can I jam any items?\", which is a yes/no question, instead ask \"What items can I jam?\" Subtle difference, but the latter makes you question your choices a lot more and forces you to explore different options. Sometimes the answer is \"I don't know\" or \"I don't think I can\" which is also perfectly fine. As long as you learn something from the game, the IDK's will turn into \"I can jam this for this comp if I get these  s later\", which corresponds to an improvement in game knowledge and maco game sense. This tends to change as the game goes on, and questions  t to become \"Should I do this\" or \"Is this a good idea\" rather than \"what can I do\" so keep that in mind as well.  One final note, almost every question boils down to **\"What is the most optimal play in this situation?\"** The questions I list are just some ideas, but this question is the real question you should be asking at every point. Don't worry about thinking like a Challenger right off the bat. The game is too complicated to figure everything out in 1 game, or even 10, or maybe even 1  games. The goal is slow and steady improvement so as long as you're learning something new every watch, you'll get there eventually :P  **Early Game**  Early game (PvE and round 2) is entirely about econ management. This will most likely not change, even if the meta speeds up or slows down. A good  t leads to a good rest of game, so working on your early game will set you up for success. I'm currently working on improving my mid/late game decision making, but improving my early game has improved my overall gameplay like crazy.  1. What items can I jam? These are usually items that are good overall (GA, Zephyr, bramble) or items that work in multiple comps (red buff, IE).  2. How do I make it to the next interest threshold? This is probably the most important question. Proper econ management and being flexible usually nets me at least 30g-40g by 2-7, 40-50g if I'm streaking  3. Should I focus on winstreaking or lose streaking? How strong do I need to be to beat the 1st place guy if win streaking? How weak do I need to be ensure that I lose to the 8th place guy?  4. What is my item prioritization? And if I   a contested item, is it a better idea to open fort to try to get a better item on carousel?  **Mid Game**  Mid game (round 3-4) is primarily about transitioning and pivoting. This is where I believe most of the confusion lies, and incorrect decision making in this stage leads to bad late game, RNG blaming, tilting, demoting, etc. This is where I am currently spending most of my time analyzing my mistakes. I suggest asking as many questions as you can at every stage so you can know what your priorities are as the game progresses, when you're given things you don't expect.  1. Given the items and  s I have currently, what is the best comp/carry? It's a good idea at this round to  t having a game plan so you can prioritize items and  s in the shop.  2. Can I pivot given the  s I just received in my shop? If so, how can I pivot and what other  s do I need to make this pivot work? This requires A LOT of analysis. It requires knowledge on comp requirements, power spikes, econ management and leveling, if anyone else is contesting that  /comp, if it's meta, or even strong, itemization to make it work, etc. I usually think of this whenever I get a 4 cost, or can upgrade a 3 cost to determine if it's worth the time and investment.  3. What comps are other people playing? Maybe even if you have the perfect items for Irelia and commit to it in game, watching the vod will make you realize that 3 other people in the lobby are playing Cybers which means Irelia will be very contested so you should focus on a different comp/carry instead.  **Late Game**  Late game (round 4-5) is primarily about rounding out your comp, getting your upgrades, but also pivoting if you can't find your carry upgraded. Something that I know I do wrong is that I tunnel too much on upgraded my carry  , and if I don't get it, then I'm screwed.  1. Should I pivot carries if I don't get upgrades? This usually happens as a result of contested  s or bad RNG, where you are getting other carry  s over your own. Very situation based, but general principles should be translatable between games, like the following point.  2. What are good pivot  s? If I'm playing blaster brawler with atk speed items and no jinxes, you could maybe pivot using all the Kayles youre getting (as you probably noticed, I really like Kayle) since you already have valk synergy with MF.  3. Is this a top1 game or top4? This is something I'm working on right now. Being able to identify if your comp isn't strong enough to top 1 will help you make tough decisions to roll down to 0 at 7 to stabilize and hopefully pull out a top4 instead of always playing for a top1.  **Tips To Make Analyzing Vods Easier**  1. Scout often during game, even if you can't process the information. This way you can process the information during vods and can think of better decisions to make.  2. Have a meta comp sheet and item/  cheat sheet ready. Sometimes you don't know what the best item optimization is in game, and being able to literally go through every item combination will help you figure out what items you could have made in that situation (How many times after carousel were you like \"F*** I SHOULDA GOT THE ARMOR INSTEAD\")  3. Don't think retrospectively, think in the moment. You know everyone's placements and comps at the end of the game, but not in the middle. Don't use that knowledge when analyzing. **Think as if you're replaying the game with infinite time.** Sometimes a decision was incorrect in hindsight, but in the moment it was still a correct decision. say you bottom 4'ed because you didnt find your MF upgrade. Maybe you scouted and saw that no one was running MF, so you pick her up, only to have 2 other people randomly 2* their MF's before you can. In the moment, picking it up was right, but since the enemy highrolled, you can't make it work. In this situation, maybe you should have sold MF and pivoted back, and you still learned something from that loss. Not the best example, but hope my point got across  **Final Thoughts/TL;DR;**  High elo streamers commonly say to rewatch your vods and analyze your mistakes, but no one really tells you how. Hopefully this guide helps you work towards being a better player by giving you a direction. An added bonus is that is not limited to TFT! You can do this for regular League, or literally any game (or life skills too, tbh) you   to improve at. Just keep thinking \"What is the most optimal thing I can do in this situation?\" and you should be seeing improvement. Streaming and rewatching your vods may also not be realistic for some people, so this might not be the guide for you, but hopefully this helps those can!   Feel free to let me know your thoughts/opinions, and maybe other questions you ask yourself. Happy climbing!", "id": "fvyhkg", "num_comments": 80, "created_utc": 1586178713}, 
{"title": "Preemptive Anti-Sorcerers Guide", "author": "adosoda", "selftext": "Take this guide with a grain of salt, I'm a low plat player and spend a lot of time on PBE. But with the changes to sorcerers in PBE: 8 sorcerer trait, Xerath and Syndra now only having 40 max mana, sorcerers will be on the rise and I just  ed to share a guide on how I have personally been countering them. Of course PBE adjustments are subject to change so take account of that as well, and this guide isn't perfect so please feel free to share some criticism.  ***The Problem***  With the new changes to Syndra's max mana, mana items turn Syndra into non-stop spell casting machine one-shotting a lot of your carries. Double Seraph's and Quicksilver and  -Guardian lets her cast up to 6+ times a fight, each cast stacking more balls and doing more damage.   ***The Counter - Mystic Blademasters***    s: Kayle, Irelia, Shen, Kassadin, Lulu, Sona, Soraka, Karma.  Mystics: The most obvious thing you need to aim for is 4 mystics. With 8 Sorcerers, the enemy team will have 2 % spell power so mystics will be an easy counter to the extra damage.   Blademasters: Kayle is your main damage. Irelia and Kassadin procs mana-reaver. Irelia targets closest   to casting next. Kassadin AOE stuns, add Morellos for burn as well.   ***Items***  Kayle: Rageblade/RFC + Hand of Justice + QSS/Trap Claw  Kayle needs anti-cc and attack speed. For attack speed I use rageblade, with close battles, rageblade + hand of justice + celestial buff, keeps Kayle fully healed, but can easily be countered with morellos or red buff. RFC would also be very efficient since sorcerer teams usually have alot of b ackline. For Anti-CC scout the lobby and check your progress on 4 mystics. For example if there are stacked Syndras or if you're not close to 4 mystics, your Kayle will be one-shot early game, I recommend trap claw early if you're losing a lot of HP. If you are close to 4 mystics or your enemies don't have a lot of burst, I recommend quicksilver sash.   Kassadin: Bramble + D.Claw + Morello  Kassadin is a great frontline-cc   but is pretty squishy. Stack him with defense items and a morellos to optimize his spell cast. If you hit 4 mystics early consider using Shojin's instead of D.Claw.  Extra: Irelia or Lulu  Depending on your lobby, you could give AD items to Irelia for more damage or mana items to Lulu for extra CC.   ***Leveling***  For leveling, I did well Rushing 8, but don't be scared to use your econ to have a stronger mid-game, especially if the player damage change comes to live.   Level 5  At level 5, use Xayah as a substitute Kayle, give her the items for Kayle and switch once you find Kayle, I find Kayle 1 * stronger than Xayah 2 *. Add in early blademasters and a Blitzcrank.     Level 6-7   t adding in Mystics if AP heavy lobby. Switch out Kayle for Xayah if you're lucky, and Irelia for whatever early blademaster you had in.      Level 8  Finish Mystics and optimize your positioning. If you went Rageblade and there isn't a lot of AOE, consider having Kayle 1 hex up from backline, so she can reach their backline. Have Sona be the Blitzcrank/Infiltrator sacrifice and position Kassadin to optimize his AOE.   The finished comp should look like this:     Extra: Kayle 3 *, or Lulu 2 * with Shojin and Hurricane.  ***Weaknesses***  If you run into a Mech-Infiltrator team prioritize Zephyrs or else Kayle will be vulnerable. Zephyr should also be prioritized if you have problems against Jhin-Dark .       This is my first guide so share your criticism, again PBE changes are subject to change and this guide is just preemptive for what I feel will be a sorcerer meta.", "id": "fvnlou", "num_comments": 47, "created_utc": 1586128638}, 
{"title": "Yasuo-Yi Anti-Carry Comp", "author": "Illunimous", "selftext": "Introduction:  With the 5    s nerfs, fast-8 or fast-9 stategies is not a must anymore. So after some testing, i comes up with a new comp (idk anyone tried it before so i call dibs first). The purpose of this comp is to aimed at hyper-carry champs that is so dominated right now, e.g. shaco, vel'koz, etc. while still have enough tankiness so that yasuo doesn't get aggroed by the backline.    s:  This comp is heavily depended on 2 champs: Yasuo and Master Yi. Yasuo can one-shot any back-line while also have enough health to survive any front-line damage. Master Yi on the other hand will be the anti-frontliner with the true damage on-hit and tankiness from the heals. [The final comps should be something like this]  The priority here is to get yasuo 3 and master yi 3 as soon as possible. Also while you roll for yasuo/yi, you can pick up secondary champions as well like shen, sona since they are all 2-cost. Since this comps focuses on yasuo/yi, the supportive  s are quite flexible which i will talk about below.  Items Priority:  Gloves   BF  tear    bow   cloak   belt   armor  Yasuo items:  Hand of Justice: this is basically the core item for yasuo for obivous reasons. Heals, dmg increase, and most importantly it gives 20 mana so that yasuo can ult 2 atks sooner than normal. That's why gloves imo is the most important item early on and i will always prioritise to get it in the first carosel.   I.E: this is a must for those 3   hyper-carries like shaco/xin zhao. the 1 % dmg increase will basically vapourize any champs with only 1 ult. But be careful of players who will build thornmails so your IE is basically useless. if there's too many tanky/vanguard players in your lobby, instead of IE, you should build LW.  Last Whisper: a situational item that helps yasuo to delete tanky carries like morde or cho'gath. i say situational because yasuo main's job is to go the backline and  t deleting people. So the armor pen is not useful in such cases since usually the backline will only have 1 defensive item like ga or qss. But with teams like vanguard/pirates that have tanky carries, yasuo can delete them every easily and since they usually build tank on 1 champion like morde, jayce, darius, xin zhao, etc. the rest of the team is very squishy and very easy to clear.  Rapid firecannon: i know what you're thinking, but this is a very, VERY good item on yasuo, espically on blaster/brawler comps. Let me explain: When yasuo first ult the backline, usually what next is yasuo will  t targeting the closest champion. And usually that is the frontline since the backline is so spead out. But with RFC, the chances the yasuo can \"see\" the other backline is higher the faster he will delete them. Also with 420 range ( ~2.5 tiles idk), he will save around 1-1.5 atks for moving around. that's like free 10-15 mana depending on the atk speed. Also also, if you have RFC, you can run yasuo yi malphite for yasuo in the bottom to get that 3 rebels and also yasuo doesn't get targgeted because yi and map are taking the aggro.  Rageblade: rageblade is fine imo if you   to dps with the ult procs rageblade stacks AND it increases the ult hits by 1. But i don't think it is necessary since yasuo's role in this comp is suppose to be the nuker not a dps dealer.  Giantslayer: same as LW, a situational item that allows yasuo to delete tanky opponents. A LW + GS + HoJ 3   yasuo can delete a full tank 3   cho'gath with just 2 ults, no kidding. but besides that it practically a 140 -30 dmg increases depend on their current health so its a B+ item imo.  Shojin: I mean sure why not. Yasuo can proc shojin pretty fast with the blademaster trait but imo its now worth it because after everytime he ults there's a small time that he did nothing. the more he ults the more times it will be wasted. It like building lethality for master yi's q. You get good ult dps but the rest is meh.  Honorable mentions:  QSS: if you really, REALLY scared, then sure. But this items should be on champions that takes aggro like Yi or Shen.  Infiltrator: Not only you can access the enemy backline without using your ult, but you can also use your ult faster because of the 50-80% atk spd increase. The bad side is DO NOT use this with RFC because it can screw the flight sometimes.  Rabadon's deathcap: fun fact: a 3  s yasuo with double deathcap's and a rageblade can deal 15 hits per ultis, that's around 3 seconds of invulnability, which is very funny to see him casually dogde global ults like gp or mf.      Master Yi items:  QSS: this is essential to your dps as Yi will be one of your team's tanks AND dps as the same time. and with so much annoying cc right now, espically form guadians comps, QSS can allow yi to use his 5 seconds ult at its fullest. Quite ironic since both versions seems to be scared of cc in one way or another.  Rabadon's deathcap: More AP = more True DMG + more Heals. That's about it. Yi scales espically well with ap items because of the high on-hit dmg. Just a reminder that yi on-hit dmg is effectively the same as kayle's on-hit but kayle is better because it is aoe. Also remember that yi deal true damage so that it cannot be countered by defense items like thornmails or d'claw.  Warmog's: The pure health is gives is so good on Yi. A 4  HP boosts can be tranlated into 32/40/48 health regen/s. Not to mention its passive heals. Warmog's heal on 3   Yi  can evens out the burn damage from red buff/morelo while the ult can still heals for 70%.  Hextech gunblade: since Yi deals true damage the heals is gonna be constant so you can get around 30-60 hp per hit from the true damge alone. Imo it is quite overkill since Yi can heal for a huge amount already.  Trapclaw: a good defensive item to for champions that have powerful ults like vel'koz or kayle, if they are not get nuked already by yasuo. It can serves a good 3rd item for yi in the 5+ stages when you don't have any item left.  HoJ: Same reasons as yasuo on the top. But you don't really need to priorities this item on yi since yi already have a heal and the 50% increase is not that much of a big deal. Yi's job is to tank as much as possible while shreadding the frontline with his true dmg.  Honorable mentions:  Dark  s: i have once tried a 6 dark   yi before and let's just say a 2 0+ true dmg per hit is not very healthy for the game.  Titian's resolve: can be really good if it get 50 stacks but other than that it's meh.  Locket: can be nice because this comp is all frontlines so a 3  shield is nice.  Protector: playing blademaster/protector/celestial/mystic can be quite fun but it is also quite expensive because of lulu being a 5   and this is a hyper-roll comp. also the chances are very low since people are still running protector/celestial.  Early game:  Pioritize to get good items first. Therefore you have to lose steak or having 1st win and then lose streak. Your aim is to having 1st/2nd pick on the 2nd and 3rd carosel so that you can get the main items for yasuo/yi. Saves your gold and gets to 50 ASAP. You should not need to level up in this comp AT ALL, maybe level up once for 2-6 if you are not confident. Now around 3-2 is when the decision happens if you   to go this comps are not.   - If there are 2+ players running rebels, you should NOT run this comp because getting yi 3   is basically impossible. if there are 1 player running rebel, you should all-in around 3-6 or 4-1 to get your yasuo and yi 3, or when that player is rushing 7 trying to get jinx is also a good idea to roll down.   - If there are 1+ player running protector/celestial or someone is playing   guardians, you should definitely run this comp since they will reduce the pool sizes so that you can get your yasuo 3 and yi 3 faster. Also this comp basically counters theses comps because yasuo can nuked their carries easily (syndra, xin zhao).   - If there are people rolling at 6 for comps like chrono or cyber or vanguards or dark  , you can play this comp BUT you will have to all in at some point to get these 3   carries because their comps will peaked faster and is stronger before you can become strong. So i will recommend to all in at 4-3 or 4-6  depending on your current health.  Mid-Late game:  You keep rolling and rolling and rolling from 3-2 all the way up to 5-1. Priority: Yasuo   Yi   Sona   Shen   anything else. Keep an eye for your opponents for any 2  s that they need. You can just bench them because you are also rolling for 2  s  s. Also don't over roll, if it really needs to, just roll down around 40+ because your econ will be sh *t because of the unpredictability of winning of this comp. This comps hits it first power spike when you have 3 items on yasuo or yi, so be careful of streaking. And then this comps become fully \"online\" when you get 3  s yasuo and 3   yi, both have 2+ items. This is when you abolutely dominates the whole lobby because nothing can survive a yasuo 3 ults beside a mech, and even with that mech will be almost dead and your team can fight the other champions. This is when you  ted to eco again to reach 7 or 8. Get 4 Chronos and slice everything apart, or get 4 celestials to get that sweet lifesteal. Or go full rebels for that insane shield and dmg increase. Anything is possible and play dependedly on the enemy teams to secure that first place. To be honest, if you can get 3   yi and yasuo, you already secure a top 4 guarenteed because of all the damage you will deal to other players, espically the low hps ones.  Counters:   - SHEN: Ironic, the whole comp is countered one simple champion. A fully stack shen will take the aggro of yasuo away from the backline, while his ult will negate the damage from both yasuo and yi. This is why i like to get shen while rolling for yasuo, so that no one can use it against me.   - Proctector/Mystic: this can works ONLY when the enemy's team has lulu. Lulu will morphifi the 2 closest champions, in this case yasuo will be 1 % hit making 1 of your 2 carries vulnerable for 2.5 seconds. A QSS is a must when dealing with this comp or at least a trap claw or else your comp will be cc'ed to death.   - Cybernetics: with the spreading of items through the comp, the yasuo's targeting can be quite RNG and since that comps has multiple carries like irelia, kayle, ekko, it is every difficult to delete all of them at once since of their positioning. A good way of dealing this comp is to make yasuo a DPS instead of a nuker so that you can keep up with thier carries.  OTHER QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION ARE VERY WELCOMED AT THE COMMENTS AS I WILL KEEP TRYING TO IMPROVE THIS COMP FURTHER SINCE I ONLY PLAYED AROUND 30 GAMES WITH IT.

{"title": "Iron to Plat in 2 Weeks - Tips and Tricks From a New Player For New Players", "author": "CainRedfield", "selftext": "I played my first game of TFT at the  t of set 3 a little under 2 weeks ago, and I fell in love.

Here is my LoLChess profile for anyone interested:    I   to share what I have learned while picking up this game that helped me climb to plat (same elo I've been hard stuck in on Summoner's Rift for 7 years...), as well as mistakes I have made.  ** * * *DISCLAIMER * * * This is just what worked and works for me specifically in climbing from Iron to Platinum.

I tunneled way too hard on trying to make the perfect comp and shoot for 1st place or bust. But because I didn't have a strong understanding of econ and health management I realized I needed to work on a strong early and mid game to even have a chance at getting to the late game once I hit Silver elo. 2. **Don't leave items unused**  - When I  ted I would always leave a ton of items on my bench because I would be too afraid to put them on  s that I didn't know if I would be keeping. I had to realize that if you have a 2   Cait in the early game but are  ing to go for a Vanguard Sniper comp - there's nothing wrong with putting that Guinsoos, BT, GA, or whatever item you are  ing to use on your Ashe or Jhin on your Cait for the early game. It will buff your early and mid game a ton, keep your health 10-20 points higher for the later stages, and might even put you on a win streak! And then once Caitlin owes you nothing anymore, in to the dumpster she goes, and those items are ready for your Jhin or Ashe! Even if you don't   to combine them yet, why not put that chainvest on your level 1 Malphite? Maybe you sell him at level 5 because you got a giant's belt and   that red buff on Lucian now, go for it! 3. **Don't roll down to 0 unless you're below 30 health**  - I would always make the mistake of rolling down to 0 way too soon, and while it might have given me a good mid game, I would get destroyed later and place 5-6th at best because my econ was gone. I find a good rule of thumb is to keep your econ high and not roll down to nothing unless you are in dire-straights. 4. **Don't force 50 econ too hard**  - To build on the last point, I would make the mistake of not leveling at all and being level 4 vs. a lobby of level 6s. This will destroy your health. There are a ton of great leveling and econ guides out there, find a leveling strategy that works with the comp you like running and stick to it. I'd much rather get to 50 gold a few rounds later with  80 health than get to 50 gold as soon as possible with  50 health.          **Now let's touch on what you should do**  1. **Aim to win every round**  - Point 1 of what **not to do** was to point out why I don't think loss-streaking is ideal in lower elos, this point is to explain why winning is important. Not only does it keep your health higher and make hitting top 4 more likely, but the biggest reason I believe trying to win every round is important is that it teaches you how to be strong at all stages of the game. Having a strong early game can be just as important as having a strong late game, so you will   to learn what groups of 3, 4, and 5 champions work well for you and can carry you through to top 4. 2. **Make an item priority list in your head on X-3 (round before carousel)**  - Never go in to the carousel without knowing exactly what your top 1, 2, and 3 items are. Nothing is more frustrating than realizing you grabbed a sub-optimal item when the item you really needed was still available.  3. **It's ok to roll on minion rounds**  - While it isn't ideal to roll on minion rounds because you can lose out on a few gold of econ, it's worse to be on X-1 frantically rolling and making mistakes. The worst feeling ever is to be rolling too quickly and miss that   you need, or have the timer run out 2 seconds before you get that last   for your 3 *. In my opinion, it is worth the trade off of a couple gold of interest to make sure all of your rolls are optimal. If you make a mistake rolling too fast, you just lost out on the 2 gold for that reroll, as well as who-knows how much gold having to keep rerolling for a   you could have grabbed earlier if you had just taken a little more time on each roll.  4. **Force a comp**  - This might be the most controversial of my tips, but for someone who is learning the game, I think it is paramount that you choose a comp that you have the most fun playing, and force it every single game. It's like 1-tricking in SR when you're new. It lets you become proficient with a single composition, and allows you to focus more of your attention on learning the game itself rather than focusing too much on learning a bunch of different compositions sub-optimally. 5. **Force a comp with 2 late-game variations**  - Once you are comfortable with a single comp and how to play it game after game, the next step is to force a comp that can have 2 different late game variations to take you to the top 4. This gets rid of a lot of the downside of forcing a single comp. For example, my comp of choice in my climb was Vanguard Snipers. In patch 10.6 I forced it every game and did quite well. Here's what it would look like roughly:   some games there would be others building the Snipers and I would place 7-8 because I couldn't get my back-line going. Especially once 10.7 hit and everyone and their grandma is playing Jhin carry. So I learned how to play a Chrono-Vanguard variation (Chrono might not be ideal for Vanguards, but I find it really fun and not super contested) and that would look like something like this:                                                                                      Having 2 variations of the same comp lets me still play the same opening every game, but makes for an easier pivot in the mid game if I notice that 1 version of the comp is going to be too contested for me to reliably hit top 4. 6. **Try to stay away from S-tier comps**  - This might be controversial as well, but especially in lower elos, it's better to play a comp that is slightly weaker than the S-tier comps, but you can reliably build in nearly every game. You will place 1st less often sure, but you will place top 4 more often, and at the end of the day, consistently placing top 4 is how you climb. Also, I find the game is more fun when you're hitting your comp in almost every game rather than having to roll the dice on whether you will get a 1st place finish or an 8th place finish because everyone else is cannibalized the deck going for the same comp as you.  7. **Play whatever comp you have the most fun playing**  - Like in SR, at the end of the day you will climb faster and have a better time if you are playing something you love. Maybe 6 Cybers is the flavour of the month comp, but if you hate playing it, what's the point? Maybe you absolutely love playing 6 Chrono Jinx because shooting 20 rockets a second gets you excited (pun intended). Or maybe 6   Guardians with 2 Seraphs on Syndra makes you feel all tingly inside. Find the comp that makes you excited to queue up because you can't wait to put that team together! Personally, as a tank jungler and support main in SR, I've always loved being an unkillable beef cake that makes everyone else rage because even in a 5-1 they can't kill you. Well it turns out, I love playing Vanguards just as much because nothing makes me smile like watching my Morde and Jayce literally 2v8 the enemy team because the rest of the scrubs on my roster died in 2 seconds.  8. **Lastly, never blame RNG**  - Same principle as not blaming your team in SR. You have no control over RNG, what you can control though is the choices you make with the information and options you have at your disposal. Sure the heart of the cards may not have been with you that game, but you didn't come in 8th solely for that reason. If you were able to replay the exact same game with the exact same rolls and opponents, you would have been able to pull off a 5th place finish if you had just done things a little bit differently. Until you hit Challenger, I will never believe that there is absolutely nothing you could have done and were just fated by the RNG-ods to do no better than 8th (and even in Challenger, there's still things you can improve on).      I could probably go on, but looking over this, I think that's a good amount of actionable tips for new and intermediate players to implement in their games. **Again, I am not an expert or a Challenger player**. Maybe one day I will be, but this is what I have learned in my initial climb to Platinum as someone who has never played an auto-chess game before.   **I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments. Especially if you   to add on any of my points, or if you completely disagree with a point, please point it out to me. I wrote this in hopes of helping other new players, but I would be so grateful to the comm y if this could also be a  ting point for discussion to help me refine and improve my own game play as well!**", "id": "fuypws", "num_comments": 28, "created_utc": 1586025060}, 
{"title": "Gunmay Challenger guide to Calamari Brawlers, aka Void Brawlers, in patch 10.7", "author": "findmenextdoor", "selftext": "**Introduction**  Hello I'm [Gunmay]  I'm a Challenger player on NA and I was top 20 in Set 2 mainly playing Berserkers. You might of seen my detailed guide on it [here]  This guide won't be as large and detailed as that one, seeing how that guide was made after basically me playing Berserkers a whole set, but because I've been asked a lot of questions about this comp I figured I can do a smaller but still (hopefully) helpful guide to anyone out there trying to play some Void Brawlers. We're gonna go over the comp itself, item priority, early game and also some questions I get asked a lot.  Also I   to shoutout [Voltariux]  a Challenger player on EUW, for coming up with this comp concept on the first day of the patch as well as figuring out that you can manipulate Vel'koz targeting with Blitzcrank (more on that later). I've seen people credit me for coming up with the comp so I just  ed to make it clear that I did not. I've modified the items as well as the early game strategy, but in the end he was the one who came up with the comp and not me.  **So what  s are we playing?**  This comp has 7 core  s and generally at 8 what you do is add another one of your 4 cost carries as your 8th  . [Your comp at 8 will look something like this.]  I generally prefer a second Cho'gath over a second Vel'koz because Cho'gath with no items outperforms Vel'koz with no items and it's more frontline. But most of the time you just add whichever you 2   first. I'll go over other variations later in the section about level 8 vs level 9.  **Item priority**  This comp relies HEAVILY on getting perfect or at the very least close to perfect Vel'koz items. The ideal items on is Seraphs   Quicksilver Sash   Morellonomicon. There are however items that you can use instead of both QSS and Morellos, but in my opinion Seraphs is a must. I don't recommend playing Vel'koz without Seraphs. This is why if you   to force this comp, I always recommend  ting Tear in the first carousel. If you   to be more flexible however, I'd suggest aiming for Rod instead. I'll go over each item individually and also what alternatives there are as well as good Cho'gath items, as he is your secondary carry in this comp so any leftover items will almost always go on Cho'gath (with the exception of Zephyr).  *Seraphs* - The best item for Vel'koz and the only item you can't really flex and still expect good results. It's very important that Vel'koz instantly, especially if he's carrying Morellos. Partly it's because you   him to ult at the same time that Blitzcrank knocks up it's hooked target (again, more on this later) as well as one of your worst matchups is Irelia, Irelias ability makes it so she jumps to the highest mana target after shes done with her initial target. If Vel'koz is not instantly ulting, by the time Irelia kills her first target she'll instantly go on Vel'koz most of the time, basically losing you the fight by default. This is why I consider this item not flexible, but if you DO find yourself without it I recommend Shojin as you get some extra value from Chrono 2 that way.  *QSS* - This is also another item I find that in most cases is mandatory, but you CAN get away with running Trap Claw instead here a lot of the time. So it's not as doomed if you have to run Trap Claw over QSS, but it's suboptimal. The reason you   QSS is because your comp relies on your Vel'koz to ult and basically oneshot the enemy team. But to do that you have to position really far up to be able to hit the backline, meaning Vel'koz can easily be CC'd. That's why you need the QSS to reduce fight RNG variance. But like I said, Trap Claw is a decent replacement that works in a similar manner.  *Morellonomicon* - This is the most flexible of the 3 items, as both Deathcap and Jeweled Gauntlet can work very well also. However I feel like Morellos pulls ahead because since Vel'koz is ulting pretty much at the  t of the fight, getting the healing reduction and the burn on the whole team you get a ton of value out of the item, especially mid game where the fights still take a while. I suggest that you always do have a Morellos on your team, even if you end up going Deathcap on Vel'koz. You just put it on Cho'gath instead.  *Guardian Angel* - Don't build this on Vel'koz, I see a lot of people trying to use GA as the replacement for QSS but it does not work. GA is really good because it makes it so your   guarantees it's ability to go off, but Vel'koz is already instantly ulting and if he dies midcast, even if he revives with GA chances are he's not gonna ult again before he gets killed again. GA is however one of the best items on Cho'gath so if you get a GA early game don't be afraid to slam it.  *Locket of the Iron Solari* - This item is very good for the same reason it was good in Berserkers and Shadows in Set 2, because the comp already has a lot of build in damage. Locket has lost a lot of value in Set 3 because no comp could really use it well enough, but with Voids it gets a lot of value thanks to the way you position your Brawlers. That's why I think this item is actually one of the best items to make on Cho'gath, it makes your frontline even tankier AND it's really good stats for Cho'gath.  *Zephyr* - In my opinion this is still the best item in the game as it forces a reaction from your opponents in a way no other item really does. Meaning this item, especially lategame, with good positioning can win you rounds you should not normally win. The ideal holder if you wanna be Flexible is probably Kha'zix, just because his positioning is free in this comp. But if you wanna be lazy and still have good results give it to Blitzcrank.  I might as well add a bit about AD/Attack Speed items. This comp uses those very poorly, normally I use bows for Titans Resolve for Cho'gath and BF Sword for GA for Cho'gath, but if you find yourself with an abundance of either you're probably a bit screwed, which is why I say that this comp really requires good items to be played efficiently. If you do happen to get like a random AD/Attack Speed from dragon or something lategame, I normally just give it to Vi or Kha'zix. Both won't gain much from it but it's probably your best option.  **Early game**  Now this is the most fun part to me about the comp, you have a lot of different  ts with this comp. Malphie, Blitzcrank and Twisted Fate make 2 really good synergies early game in Brawler 2 and Chrono 2 and still leaves a lot of room for flexing in different  s depending on what you hit. I'll give some examples on level 5 comps and I'll use the Seraphs QSS Morellos icons to indicate which   holds your Vel'koz items during the early stages. This does not mean you normally have these items, just   to point that out.  [Infiltrator version at level 5]  - Probably the strongest version, as it also let's you make use of the Kha'zix you have to pick up during early game anyways, making it easier to econ. Also Kaisa is a really good user of both Morellos and Seraphs.  [Rebel version at level 5]  - Also another really good  t, because it's easy to find early and Ziggs is really good with Seraphs early. This can winstreak most games and is the one I find myself using the most.  [  Guardian version at level 5]  - This is basically just Leona, Poppy, Ahri and Zoe + whatever other upgraded   you can get your hands on. Ahri is really good with Morellos and can really do some good damage if you 2   her early. Another alternative is to go 4 Vanguards with Poppy holding your items, as Poppy with Seraphs and Vanguard buff is basically unkillable for most of early game.  There are more variations, but I think those 3 are some good examples and you guys can figure out similar early game comps. Basically anything that can make you strong early game and has a carry that can use the Vel'koz items is gonna be a decent  t.  **Mid-Late game**  So because the comp \"comes online\" at level 7, I see a lot of people do the mistake of rolling at 7 to a point where it ruins their economy. The win condition of this comp is to 3   Vel'koz or Cho'gath (or both) and to do that you need really good economy to be able to slowroll at level 8. That's why you   to make a good comp early game so that you can stay healthy enough to slowly level to 8 with excess gold (all gold above 50 gold) and then when you get to level 8 you switch to rolling the excess gold for your  s. This can obviously change depending on the situation, sometimes you lose streak super hard early and you're bleeding out really quickly then you have to do something about it. In that situation I normally slowroll at 7 until I feel I'm strong enough to go level 8. But generally you   to stay above 50 gold at all points while rolling excess gold at level 8, looking to 3   Vel'koz and Cho'gath, or at the very least find 2x 2* versions of them.  **When do I all-in?**  Because you're slowrolling at 8, other people are gonna spike while you're looking for your  s meaning you'll end up losing some fights later on. So you can't keep doing this forever, eventually you have to all in and roll all your gold to hit your 3  s, but you   to do this as late as possible to give yourself the best odds of actually finding it. My rule of thumb is I'll be willing to greed until I have \"2 lives\" left. Meaning that my HP is low enough that losing 2 rounds will kill me. You   2 to reduce variance, since even if you 3   your  s, fight RNG can still give you a loss sometimes so having 2 lives gives you more of a chance of survival even if the chance of finding your  s are a bit lower because you'll have 1 round of gold less. So generally this is around 30 HP in lategame, and you'll just roll down all your gold for Cho'gath and Vel'koz.  **Level 8 vs Level 9**  I get asked this a lot, why not go 9 for the better chance at rolling 4 costs, or why not go 9 to add 4 Sorc / 2 Mystic / 2 Celestial. You don't go 9 for added chance at 4 costs because it costs 66 gold to level to 9, it's not worth 33 rolls for the added chance. Because you also still need gold to roll down with, and eventually time will run out. It's just not possible in most games to actually go 9. Also you'll need to find more replacement  s if you do find 3   Vel'koz and Cho'gath, which is even more gold.  So when do you go level 9? You go 9 when you're getting contested. Either directly or indirectly. Since there is only 12 of each 4 cost in the pool, depending on what the lobby is playing, it can actually be impossible to 3   your 4 costs. So if someone else is going the same comp, or if you have people just playing Brawlers or Sorcs in general, you might find yourself with no way of actually getting 3  s. Then what you do is you go level 9 and you add in either 4 Sorcs (if you need damage), 2 Mystic (if you're facing Magic damage) or 2 Celestial (if you're facing Physical damage). Normally I prefer Celestial at 9 because Lulu and Ashe adds more CC as well as Celestial being a really good defensive tool against most matchups. Mystic is limited to only Magic damage, which is not very prevelent in the meta at the moment and 4 Sorcs generally won't do much late game. I only go 4 Sorcs if I have no need for more defense, which is very rare.  **Counters**  The 2 worst matchups for this comp is Mech Infiltrators and Cybernetics. The mech has a lot of raw HP, which is the best defensive stat vs True Damage and also they have 3 Assassin  s that'll jump your backline and eventually find their way to Vel'koz. Cybernetics is similar in that they have a lot of backline access but also Irelia with Mana Reaver is super hard to deal with if she finds her way to Vel'koz. Against both of these comps, getting 3   Cho'gath is actually more helpful than 3   Vel'koz because he'll be tanky enough to survive and he still has 2 0 base damage at 3   so he'll be able to oneshot people just as well as Vel'koz.   Because it's bad matchups vs the 2 best comps currently I can't put this comp at S-Tier, but instead I'm putting it around A-Tier with a similar strength as Dark s.  **Positioning**  [This]  is the default positioning you'll have most of the time. The reason you position like this is because this way Vel'koz will hit the backline with his ult. Also by using Blitzcrank we can manipulate Vel'koz shitty AI to actually pretty realiably ult upwards. Blitzcrank will hook a target and it'll land infront of him (because there is no room to the sides) and once Blitzcrank knocks up his target it causes  s around him to target his target. Meaning Vel'koz in this case. This is also why you   Seraphs, because the ult timing will be around the same time Blitz knocks up his target, so Vel'koz will ult around there, with him often trending towards  ting at the top side.  You move the comp from the right to the left depending on who you're targeting has their carries, since you   Vel'koz to hit them. [This]  is how it looks on the left side, it's basically just mirroring the right side. The most important thing is to have Vel'koz behind Blitz, with Blitz in the top corner and with Vi next to Blitz. Vi being next to Blitz is really important because she'll always ult the furthest target away from her, which means the corner Vel'koz can't reach. That buys you time incase you miss positioned and the enemy moved their  s from your Vel'koz, basically granting you a chance anyways.  Now there are some exceptions to this positioning, it's when you're facing Mech Infiltrators. This is something I'm still trying out while trying to find a way to make this matchup more favorable for Void Brawlers so I can't guarantee it'll always work. But it's given me more of a fighting chance at least. [This]  is what the positioning looks like. Basically the idea is to keep Shaco away from your Vel'koz but also not letting the mech just run in and aoe you down. You put one of the brawlers upfront to bait the Mech for a bit while hopefully your double Velkoz deal with Shaco and Kaisa. By positioning in the corner like this with 3 range  s in the back, your Vel'koz with items should have enough time to kill the Infiltrators about the same time as the Mech kills your Brawler. Most of the time you'll go against Mechs at level 7 (maybe 8) at this point, so they will only have the Mech + Infiltrators + Kayle. Blitz will hook in Kayle so it does not damage the Brawler that's buying time with the Mech. Like I said, it's not exact science but I've found it to give me a good chance at actually beating Mech Infiltrators in the 1v1 endgame. Note that you should not do this unless you know you're fighting Mech Infiltrator, because vs any other comp this is a grief. This does not help vs Cybernetics for example.  **\"Have you seen the Blaster/Mech/Infiltrator versions of this comp and what is your thoughts on them?\"**  All of them suck.   The 2 Blaster version is pointless since the comp revolves around Void, you're spreading yourself to thin while trying to fit in to much to stay flexible. Just play Brawler Blasters instead. If you're finding yourself with AD items in Void Brawlers it means you hard forced it when you should not of done so.  The Mech Void version is bad as well, just play normal Sorc Mech instead (or Mech Infiltrator if you actually care about your elo), it's gonna give you better results. A second Cho'gath 2 in this comp is literally stronger than the Mech would be if you put it in.  The Infiltrator version is literally an 8th every time, Kha'zix is in no shape or form a carry in this comp. He's only there for the Void buff. Don't get baited into investing in him.  **\"Is 2x Cho'gath 2   better than Cho'gath 3  ?\"**  No, Cho'gath 3 is one of your win conditions. His ult base damage goes up from 250 to 2 0, he basically  ts oneshotting everything in his way. I know that in Set 1 his base damage at 3   was pathetic, but at 2 0 damage he'll carry you. He's also the best 3   out of the two when facing Mech Infiltrator and Cybernetics, your hardest matchups.  **\"Why don't you ever 3   Kha'zix?\"**  Because he's next to useless in this comp. Also because you don't roll until 7 at the earliest, meaning your chance at actually finding Kha'zix is extremly small. But like I mentioned earlier, even if you did 3   him, he's a waste of 9 gold. He'll do nothing. This is the Vel'koz and Cho'gath show and Kha'zix is just a backup dancer.  **Other questions and some shameless advertising**  If you have any other questions that I maybe did not cover in the guide, I always do my best to answer questions when I'm streaming live at   and I stream every day 20:  to  :  CET. So if you catch me live ask away and I'll do my best to answer any questions you might have.

{"title": "Void/Brawler Guide", "author": "Astordor", "selftext": "Hi guys, I just became \"Content Creator\" on the Competitive TFT discord server, so this guide is probably gonna be the first of a long series. Let's get  ted !     The comp I'm gonna talk about is the Brawler/Void one, with Vel'Koz carry. I know Vel'Koz AI is really pepega, but if you position it correctly, it can really do the job.   Here is what it looks like at level 7, 4 brawlers/void/2 sorc :    There is only one prerequisite to play this comp : a seraph's embrace on Vel'Koz. It is the only mandatory item, everything else is very flexible. The reason is, you   Vel'Koz to cast right at the beginning of the fight, so he can kill the ennemy backlane almost instantly. Without it, he will take too long to cast, your whole team is gonna die and he'll get destroyed.      Items :   Vel'Koz : Seraph's embrace + AP item (whatever you get) + Defensive item (Trap Claw/Quicksilver)/any item made with a tear. With seraph + a tear, your Vel'Koz will cast really quickly. The ultimate build is 2 seraphs + Deathcape.   Cho'Gath : any defensive items, GA is good.   When both of them have 3 items, you can give the left over to Vi/your second sorcerer.      Econ :   Transition comp until level 7, there is a lot of good item holders for Vel'Koz (Ahri/Syndra/TF/Ziggs/Lucian/Darius...). You should hit level 7 at wolves then roll a bit until you are strong enough to go to 8. You should get most of the comp online, but don't panic if you don't find Vel'Koz/Cho'Gath : grab some strong  s on the way so you can have a strong transition comp. Syndra 2  s can carry you until level 8, and you can have a 2 brawlers/2 vanguard frontlane for example. Once you're done, just go back to 50g, get level 8 after raptors and upgrade the whole final comp.   You may have noticed, but the comp I mentionned is online level 7, so why do we   to get to 8? The win condition is to get Vel'Koz or Cho'gath 3  s (Vel'Koz is the priority), so you   to increase your odds of getting 4-cost  s. Getting to level 9 isn't worth, stay level 8. When you have your whole comp upgraded, go back to 50 golds and roll everything above 50g to get Vel'Koz 3  s. If you're low on health and you're about to die, all in. If you only need a few Vel'Koz, all in.  The 8th champ you put at level 8 can either be a random 2  s legendary if you find it, or a 2nd Cho'Gath/Vel'Koz upgraded. A 2nd Blitzcrank is very good aswell.      Positionning :   Your positionning should look like the one I posted at the beginning. Cho'Gath is centered so he tanks and casts faster, brawlers are covering the frontlane. Vel'Koz is hidden just behind a brawler on the side, he needs to be there if you   his spell to hit most of the ennemy team, backlane included. Try to put your Vel'Koz on the same side as the ennemy team carries. Finally, you put your last sorc behind Vel'Koz to protect him from ennemy's blitzcrank/infiltrators. If you know you're gonna face a shaco, you can put a brawler behind Vel'Koz so the shaco stick on it a little longer, that will buy time for Vel'Koz to clean up.     General tips :    - Vel'Koz 3  s sounds harder than it really is. I played this comp a lot from diamond to challenger, and got it half of my games.    - When rolling for Vel'Koz/Cho'Gath, buy every 4-cost you find (don't 2   them), it will reduce the amount of 4 costs in the pool, which will increase your odds of finding the ones you  . At the end of the round, sell the 4-cost you don't  .    - Don't get baited by Chrono, Lux is a way better sorcerer than TF, some attack speed is not worth her spell.    - If you're not alone on the comp, you can rush level 9 and give up on the Vel'Koz 3  s. Then you can add in the 4 sorc bonus, or some legendaries 2  s. If you're contested by someone who is about to die, save your golds at level 8, and roll when he's dead.    - You can transition on mech/sorcerer if you don't get Vel'Koz.     - If you have a good game, you can try to get Blitz/Vi to 3  s.     - Scout to know if you're contested or not, and try to put your Vel'Koz on the best side each round, depending on the ennemy teams. It is really easier for you to move one champ than for them to move the whole team, so use that to win fights.    - Not really a tip, just so you know : the cyborg match up can be really hard, if Irelia one shot your Vel'Koz you just can't win. Sometimes you will win with Vel'Koz 2 then lose with Vel'Koz 3, just because Irelia decided to fuck you up. Just BlessRNG I guess.

{"title": "kentwuhoo's Guide to Intermediate Concepts (to help you hit Diamond!)", "author": "kentwuhoo", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm kentwuhoo and I'm a GM player who wrote a few guides last set: [Early Game Guide + Shadows Tips   Tricks]  [Set 2 Climbing Guidebook]   There are lots of new players who are looking to climb this set so I'm back with a guide that aims to help players who understand the basics but need help with the intermediate concepts. My goal is not just to have a guide for you to follow, but also to help you learn to make adapted decisions as you play. **I believe that you can hit diamond** if you follow this guide and get good at executing all these concepts.  This guide covers:  * Comps   Transitions * Econ   Rolling * Scouting   Positioning * Items  I'll be around to answer questions so feel free to leave them down below. I also stream regularly at [twitch.tv/kentwuhoo]  where I talk through my thought process for all my decisions, so drop a follow if you're interested. Happy climbing :)  **Comps   Transitions**  * Learn two comps that you like to play and spam them based on what items you get. Sticking to a couple comps helps you:     * Learn how to flexibly transition into them     * Roll down faster and more accurately during crucial turns    * Learn what adaptations of the comp are still strong even if you don't hit your optimal  s * You can find detailed comp guides throughout this sub that teach you when to level, when to roll, and what early/midgame  s to pick up    * Most importantly, learn to transition the comp quickly. **On the turn before rolling your gold, have an idea of what you're going to buy as you roll down and what you'll be replacing on your board if you hit those  s.** Tell yourself  ok I'm looking for Irelia, Kayle, and Vi. I can stop if I hit 1 Irelia.     * Being able to transition quickly means you don't take extra damage during your transition    * The priority during transition should be: put new  s on board -  position them correctly -  place  t-of-round items (zephyr, shroud, locket) -  place other items    * /u/thatsPRIMAL put together some really good comp guides (linked below). If you do a quick search for  guide  you can find more from other posters as well. Keep in mind that these aren't all the viable comps but just some examples.       * [Jhin]        * [Cybernetics]        * [  Guardians]  (last patch)       * [Vanguard Pirates]  (last patch) * Think about the game in multiple \"segments.\" You'll likely change out a lot of  s between each stage    * Earlygame -  Midgame -  Lategame    * This means that just because you  t with 3Rebels doesn't mean that your lategame comp has to be 6Rebels. You can and should play strong early game boards like 3Rebels or 3Cybers to winstreak and save HP, and then transition into a midgame comp that fits your lategame build    * For example, if you plan on playing Cybers, you can have an earlygame carry hold your Irelia/Ekko items so that you have a strong board through the early stages. Once you hit your lategame carries you should sell the earlygame carry and move the items over to Irelia/Ekko       * In this example, I'd have Lucian hold items and be sure to grab an extra Lucian so I can replace him when I sell him to move items over to Irelia/Ekko    * **For most comps, you won't be going for 3 *  s** so don't hold extra copies of  s once you 2 * them because it'll hurt your econ. The only time you   to go for 3 * is if:       * You're playing a comp centered around 3 *ing  s. The only two current meta comps that do this are Mech Infiltrators and Protectors       * It's lategame and you've hit most of your other upgrades, then you can 3 * your 4-cost carry as a win condition. Don't waste gold on support  s or secondary carries (for example, if you're running 6 cybers with Irelia carry and a naked Kayle, don't go for 3 * Kayle)  **Econ and Rolling** *(note: these are general tips that apply to most comps. Some comps have very specific playstyles and you should follow the guides for those)*  * For most comps, you don't   to roll every turn. There are specific turns that you'll roll for  s. In this current meta, most comps roll at level 7 and level 8, and rarely ever before that * You should only roll when you have a reason to roll. Some examples:    * You are sitting on 2+ pairs of core  s and you have a winstreak. You might   to roll a little to strengthen your board and continue your winstreak, but you don't   to kill your econ by doing so. If you're unsure that the powerspike will guarantee your winstreak, it's better to play it safe and continue to gain econ    * You hit a level threshold. For example, you just leveled to 7 and now have an increased chance of hitting a core 4 cost  . You might   to roll down and find it. (Percentages at each level can be found here:      * In general, you roll at 7 to upgrade 3 costs and find 4 costs; you roll at 8 to find 5 costs and upgrade 4 costs    * You are 1-2 losses from death ( 30hp). You should go all-in and roll. Whether you need to level+roll or just roll depends on your team composition and current gold. Ask yourself:  if I level is there anything I can add that makes me stronger?  and  Leveling will increase the chance I hit 5 costs, but how much gold will I have to roll after leveling?         * If you have 50 gold and spend 36 on leveling, you only have 14 gold to roll and even less if you buy any  s along the way    * Only go level 9 when you finish your level 8 board. This means you have all  s for your level 8 comp plus all your important  s are upgraded. If you go 9 with a weak board, you'll lose big fights against others who rolled everything at 8    * Stop rolling when your board seems strong enough. Gauging this will come with experience, but for example if you hit Ekko and now have 6 cybers, you can econ for a bit without needing to roll for more upgrades        * If your  s are heavily contested, then you may   to keep rolling to hit the upgrades first    * **Streaks are key.** Streaks in either direction currently give you +3 gold per round (even on PVE rounds) so you can make an insane amount of money by streaking       * If you have a strong opener (multiple 2 *  s or one 2 *   + strong early synergy like cybers), you can use items right away and push a winstreak. Ideally you   to winstreak into Krugs so you get +3g for Krugs too       * If you have a weak opener, it's okay to play a very weak board and focus on econ. Early game player damage is low right now so you won't get hit too hard    * If you're winstreaking early game (before Krugs) and see that leveling to 5 will strengthen your board, you can level after carousel even if it costs you 1 econ. This guarantees your winstreak and gets you +3g from each of the next 2 rounds and +3g from Krugs. **Make sure to scout before you do this (use carousel downtime to scout), focusing on the other winstreakers**. See how strong their boards are relative to yours before committing to the level up. You   to guarantee your win if you give up the 1 econ  **Scouting and Positioning**  * The rule of thumb is:    * **Melee tanks** on row 1 so that they get hit first and to create space for your ranged carries. If they're farther away from your ranged carries, the enemy  s have to walk further after killing your frontline    * **Melee carries** on row 2 so that they don't get targeted first but are still close enough to the front to get in on the action right away    * **Ranged carries** in the back corners so that they're farthest away from enemy  s. This gives them the most time to attack safely and avoid AOE CC like Chogath and GP * Examples:    * Cybers:      * Blasters:   * Scout and look out for:    * **Zephyrs**   Position your key  s away from Zephyrs. A common trick is to put your important   (MF) next to a bait   (Lucian) and switch them last second so that the enemy zephyrs the bait    * **Infiltrators**   Put your backline carries on the opposite side of infiltrators and put a bait   to distract the infiltrator. Having two  s in a corner helps buy your   additional time too (see examples in links above)       * If the enemy has a weak infiltrator lategame (khazix without items), consider letting it hit your carry to give your carry free mana    * **Blitzcrank**   Position your backline carry on the same side as Blitz and have a bait   on the other end        * In this example, Blitz will pull Ez and not MF:         * Another way to do it is to have a bait in the corner and your carry one space away. This is easier, but opens you up to Infiltrators    * **Mana Reavers**   Make sure your key frontline  s (Cho, GP, Lulu, etc.) won't get instantly hit by mana reavers, which significantly slows down your team's CC. Cho ult going off fast could make or break a fight    * **Bramblevest/Shen**   When playing AD comps, try to have your carry (Irelia, Jhin, Jinx, etc.) on the opposite side of Bramblevests and Shens. Those will stall your carry forever while the rest of the enemy team kills your team, especially since you need Jinx to get a kill ASAP to activate her passive * **KEYBIND TIP:** Q and R help you cycle through enemy boards quickly. Press space to go back to your board. This is helpful when you need to quickly scan for Zephyrs   **Items**  * If you have 4+ item components, build something (unless you're forcing an early lose streak). It's greedy to hold on to 4 or more item components because it's unlikely that you'll get 4 more components that'll make 4 perfect items.    * Early items can drastically change the flow of your game. You don't   to take unnecessary damage midgame because you greeded all your items, then run out of time to find your crucial high-cost  s    * The best items to build early are ones that are flexible in the comps that you play, which leads to  * Look at in-depth guides for your comp and find out which items are best-in-slot for the comp, and which items are just okay but still work.

{"title": "Challenger 4 LP Initial thoughts on 10.7 Meta and Brief comp Guides", "author": "Chatskiiees", "selftext": "Hey reddit! I'm a challenger player on OCE in all 3 sets of tft. A few people on my stream (which you can find [here]  suggested i make a guide with my initial reactions to the new patch and what comps i think, after playing 30 or so games on the first day, will be strong. Use this as a way to get  ted in 10.7 until the meta settles and maybe get a little free LP before everyone catches on. If you have any questions feel free to leave them here or ask me on stream. Let's get into it!  # Key Information  * Physical damage based comps are almost surely going to be the strongest on 10.7. BF sword is extremely valuable due to IE (and to a lesser extent GA/GS) being a core component in many of the comps that will be good. Jinx/Jhin/Irelia are going to dominate this patch. * Rebels are not broken. The rebel spam is certainly over and we will see new comps come to the forefront of the meta. Many people are playing comps based around 4 cost carries rather than 5 cost carries as hitting them on 8 is less consistent (due to the % nerfs). The asol targeting nerf is also noticeable. The comp can still be strong with rebel GP spat I've found but without asol 2 you will bleed out if you are not winstreaking and often hit a hard 6-8th place game. You will not see many rebel players outside of neekoverse games as this comp is very inconsistent across many games. * Speaking of neekoverse, the galaxies changes effect the game dramatically, with the most influential being the Lilac (4-cost carousel) galaxy. An early game BF jhin/irelia or a kayle/fizz is extremely strong in getting early synergies such as cybers/snipers/mechs online. Watch your hp in these games because everyone is trying to win streak! Additionally, the 125HP is not as influential as i thought it would be and only lengthens the game an average of 1-2 rounds, with the strongest player usually already being decided long before that stage. Loss-streaking is less punishable in this galaxy for obviously reasons and is therefore a more strategy. Everyone saves neeko's help in the neekoverse for 5 costs and i only don't when i need to spike and am losing all of stage 3. * Front-line should not be underestimated. I expect 4 vanguard mid game to be an almost guaranteed top 4 especially since it counters commonly thought to be strong mid game comps like blasters/cybers, blademasters and chrono. 4 brawler nerf is almost entirely unnoticeable and will remain strong due to all 4 of the brawlers being very good  s. (Malphite is personally one of my favourite set 3  s) * 6 Blademasters has potential but gets out-scaled pretty hard in the late game without a perfect Kayle (and sometimes even with it). * Gangplank is still good. Gangplank feels like a balanced   now, although hitting his better upgrades (two strikes and larger area) in any comp where you have 2 demolitionists is still extremely strong and can easily propel you to 1st. * Kassadin is good but bad. Kassadin is a very strong   now but he struggles to find a place in many of the comps i suspect will be good. The only success i've seen him have is as a 3   in protectors, but this is not a consistent strategy due to its high level of contention.  * Ezreal is bad but bad. Not a typo, they butchered Ezreal and he feels extremely bad to play. He will only be played for synergies do not stack items on him just use him as a transitional   and cut him where possible. Shen 1 is better than Ezreal 2 in my opinion. * There is little hope for AP on this patch, but i will get into the best version of set 3 sorcs i think has potential, especially now that mystic and d/claw will be rarely played.  # 10.7 Team Compositions  * **S+** [**Jhin Vanguards**]  I expect this comp to dominate the meta. Not much has changed from last patch (of which there were several great guides on this sub) except i think vanguard 4 will remain in the endgame comp. The wu buff feels nice and rebels (which were the main reason for mystics) are weaker and with ad populating the meta, vanguard will naturally be strong. Make sure you try to winstreak midgame with 4 vanguard and get to 7 before you  t rolling heavily. Consider rolling at 3-2 for 4 vanguard if needed (but not too much, you need to 8 to find Lulu). Prioritise jhin items over all others (especially IE/GA) * **S** [**Blasters Brawlers**]  This team composition will be strong this patch. Jinx has lost none of her set 1 potency and will sometimes just 1v9 out of nowhere. Try to play 2 blasters with ezreal lucian and 4 brawlers at 6 if you find and early cho. You can roll at 7 with this comp and run 4 blasters later in the game if you think jinx will be contested (usually at stage 4-1). Do not prioritise running 4 blaster over 4 brawer. Prioritise jinx items (those 3 all perfect) and run  any excess damage items on mf as a secondary carry or tank items on cho. * **A++** [**New Age Cybernetiks**]  The new age of cybernetiks is here and oh man does mana reaver feel good. This comp is a more powerful version of 10.6 cybers and can sometimes top 1 with 2   Irelia now (a problem with cybers in 10.6). The late game is still weaker than a few other comps but with perfect items and a good 2   legendary on the bench for thresh to pull in this comp can do very well. Shen is also very good in 10.7 due to Jhin and jinx being strong. Play to hit 8 and find ekko. Winstreak through stage 3 this comp is weak if you bleed hp in the mid game. * **A-S? Sorcerers, Mechs,   Guardians Oh My!** It's early in the patch, so i don't know which variation of these comps is the best but i will explain my reasoning. Spatula makes this an insta top 4 comp in my opinion. A   guardian spatula will give [this]  comp at 8 and is extremely powerful with a neeko 3 or a stacked syndra 3/Vel 2. The vel koz and soraka buffs feel like they push this comp over the line to be good. A typical winstreaking through stage 3 sorc game may look like [this]  at seven with perhaps an annie or lux in for vel if u haven't hit. A mistake i often see with this comp is not prioritising the neeko items. Besides the   guardian spat, the ionic and ga (and to a slightly lesser extent morello) are the most important to counter D claw and Jhin respectively (jhin can kill neeko before her first cast and then ur in trouble) Obviously, hitting spatula is not a consistent strategy but i have had success playing mechs at 8 in [this]  composition with a stacked vel and mech (or syndra 3). I will do a complete guide on this composition if enough people   to see it and after i do some more testing. * **A Protectors/Rebels/Mech infiltrators** are much the same as 10.6 far as i can tell. Still rush 8 in rebels, go for shaco 3 in mechs hes still a carry and stay at 5 rolling for xin and rakan in protectors with maybe the addition of kassadin at 7-8 over 4 mystic. Similar stuff. These comps can all do well when uncontested. If they are contested you're gonna need a lot of luck or it will be a play for 4th kind of game.  # Final Thoughts and TL/DR  Patch 10.7 has already felt to me way more enjoyable than 10.6. Rebels and GP is ok still but are a shadow of their former selves and honestly it couldn't make me happier. AD based carries will dominate the meta and BF sword is extremely contested so don't expect one if u are winstreaking. Try out some of the comps I've gone over and let me know what you think!

{"title": "Grandmaster Tips | Adjusting to Meta Shifts (Plus thoughts on new Galaxies)", "author": "AlanLube", "selftext": " What's up everyone. I'm AlanLube and I've hit Grandmaster in both set 1 and set 2 and just  ed to share some fundamentals with everyone. I definitely am not the best player here, and there will be more qualified people to teach you what I'm about to, but I'm going to try my best to explain my thought process going into patches and how to adjust my gameplay based on the matches I play.  For a more in depth write up (geared more toward beginners): I have a full article here:       **First off, Read the patch, and read what people think about it**   Every patch changes the meta quite drastically (except maybe the last 2 patches of a set). The meta is usually completely different right when the patch hits, and most times, it shifts even more after the first few days. Considering all the many resources of patch notes (infographics, writeups, videos), there's no reason you shouldn't be up to date on what's coming.   **But what's even more important** is going on subreddits like this, or streams, or youtube comments to see what people think about the patch. If everyone believes X comp is going to be busted, you should use that to your advantage.     **Leveling Strategies**   There's plenty of guides on hyper rolling, slow rolling, \"regular 4 cost carry leveling\", Fast 8, etc. All I   you to remember is to associate the leveling strategy to the   cost. It may seem very basic. If my carry is 1 cost I hyperroll, if my carry is 5 cost, I fast 8 and so on, but what if your comp has multiple carries? A great example is 6 Shadow from set 2. While you could definitely Fast 8 for Master Yi, players knew that Kindred and Sion allowed for a very strong midgame. Because of this, players rolled down more at level 6 for these 3 cost  s, and didn't have to rely on Fast 8 for Master Yi. Obviously, there are many circumstances that are different now, (player damage, streak gold), but the lesson remains. So really there are two options going immediately into a patch.     **Follow the Trend but do it better**   If you go into the patch  ing to play what is contested, (for example Rangers in set 2 when every other comp got nerfed). Be prepared to come up with your own leveling strategy that puts you above your competition. Many times, people stick to a similar leveling strategy or a leveling strategy that worked for them in the previous patch and don't adapt quickly enough to meta shifts. If 3 cost carries dominate the meta, and the comp you play centers around a 4 cost, you might   to make your leveling strategy more aggressive to compensate. Or vice versa. If Reddit makes a post about a new comp thats tearing it up, think about how it'll affect the speed of the meta and play other comps accordingly.     **Go against the trend**   This one requires a bit more theorycrafting and experimentation and for me is more difficult than the previous option. Early in set 2, the meta was extremely slow and people Fast 8'd all the time to look for Zed and Singed. Even so, a few players came up with 6 Inferno. This comp rolled more aggressively early game to build a win streak, and held on to the advantage even late game with even a 1   Amumu. Now this may not translate extremely well in set 3 (because of the player damage changes that make the game more late game focused), but you can take this example to see how doing something different can sometimes lead to great results.     **If you see it on stream or reddit, you're too late to the party**   If you see a comp on stream or a guide on Reddit, there are hundreds if not thousands of other players who are seeing it at the same time you are. If you follow the guide word for word, or try to replicate what you saw on stream. Chances are multiple people in your lobby are also doing the same thing. This is where the two above options require critical thinking on **YOUR** part. Think about how fast the meta is, the cost of the most contested and strongest carries. And find a solution to it. Sure you can definitely climb forcing one comp over and over, but being able to discern a proper strategy for your lobby and elo is paramount to climbing higher.     **The new galaxies coming to Set 3 and my personal thoughts**   Patch 10.7 will be extremely different from previous patches as the new galaxies have the potential to completely warp the meta. This is a prime opport y to think of strategies for yourself to gain a competitive advantage. To give an example, I'll give some a few thoughts on what I expect from the coming galaxies.     **Neekoverse (2 Neeko to everyone)**   Most people are looking at this Galaxy as a juicy 2   Ekko, Asol, GP, or MF. Some players will likely use it on slow roll comps like Protectors or Mech Infiltrators. Naturally, this means people will be more greedy when they play. So what can you do? Option 1: Do it better: If you're playing the same comp as someone else, consider rolling down a turn early. Even if you lose out on about 5 gold, if you find even one copy of ASol or Ekko, if you double Neeko, your opposition will have a much harder time finding the same  . Option 2: Go against the trend. Maybe you prefer to play a top 4 playstyle. If so you might consider running a 4 cost carry. At level 5 or 6, If you find an Irelia or Kayle or Jinx, it may be worth using the double Neeko instantly to try and guarantee a winstreak midgame. While you will lose out to other players who greed for 3   Xin or 2   Asol/Ekko, you will likely have a decent enough health pool to maintain a top 4 position.     **Not So Little Legend (+25  ting health to everyone)**   This one I find to be the least interesting of the galaxies. +25 health in stage 6 basically means 2 extra turns to live. While it is possible that the meta can evolve to a level 9 based comp, I find it quite unlikely. If players slow the meta to build economy, it will definitely favor players to win streak again. And even if the player damage early game is too low, the damage taken during stage 4 and 5 are definitely enough to make things difficult. So in my opinion, it'll be a galaxy where players are incentivized to go fast 8 or play greedily (kinda like 10.6). I won't go into how to counteract this, since you should think up that yourself and I don't   to type too much (I mean I already have but still).     **Lilac ( ting 4 cost carousel)**   For me, this one going to separate the carousel gods from the rest of the pack. Practice getting the   you   from carousel now, because this will definitely shake things up. Once again, I won't go too much into detail, but a tip for you guys. Take a quick second to scout every player after the initial creep rounds and see who is hard forcing their comp (Likely the players who got a good 4 cost   like Fizz or Jhin, etc). You could then try and find the comp that is least contested based on the assumption that the other players will force whatever comp matches their 4 cost. Or you can be a god and always nab the best   off the carousel. Either works.     **Conclusion**   To wrap things up, I'm confident that many players on this subreddit already do many of these things. You may not have found anything particularly new, but I hope some of y'all did. And even if you already thought of these things, maybe reading it in a format like this will help you organize your thoughts more. One of the questions I see a lot on this subreddit is **How do I learn from my past games** and while you may notice a misplay here or there on itemization or positioning, those are all very micro oriented. Take the time to also look at the big picture of the state of the meta, the speed of the meta, the trend, etc. As you think about these things, you will be able to see what you predicted and whether or not it came to fruition. These are the things that build up your game sense and let you play how you   to play rather than following guides. (No shade to guides, they provide great insight for players and great insight for players like me on how to counterplay).     **TLDR**: Think about the cost of carries, the speed of the meta, and figure out a strategy before everyone else on Reddit does.

GO for Tear -  Rod -  BF -  Belt -  Vest -  Gloves at First carousel  FLEXIBLE with other 2   and Don't ruin your economy  ROUND 3-2 TO 6 AND ROLL a bit to contest for Brawler   Blaster, but still bench them if you're having stronger 2    WIN STREAK, consider Fast 7 and Roll a bit for Power spike with Brawlasters upgrade to replace board  STACK Ez with Miss items, Luci with Jinx items, always look for another Ez, Luci to transfer items later  ITEMS: DMG only, no need DEF. Give to these 4 only: Cho (Morello), Ez, Jinx and Miss (Mana, QSS, GA)  FAST 8 as fast as you can and Roll down to look for Miss/ any other 5 cost 2   (GP is broken)      **MID GAME**  DO NOT roll to wish for any 3   if others are contesting hard, wish them to die first  ROLL the fuck down after all the contesters are dead  TOO MUCH \"Shaco   Friends\" abuser at the moment so put some Meatballs around your cores to buy time  WHEN the STRONG Shaco Gang is dead or you just fight him recent rounds, put back some Meatballs to Frontline  CONTESTED by 3 comps only (Cyber, Rebel   Space Pirates) so be sure to check around what should you keep for 3  . Only these 3 are worth: Cho, Vi and Jinx. Miss 3 is a fucking free win btw      **LATE GAME**  ALWAYS put 1 or 2 useless Meatballs at the corners (definitely Blit   Mal) to let them hooked by other Blits  BEST to put in before you get Miss: Asol (for Rebel), Ekko/ Ire (for Cyber), GP (nothing, he's just broken), Thresh (the more the merrier)  JINX BESIDE BLIT, so the pulled one will die instantly and she is hyped. But watch out for Zephyr, it's not worth it  MISS CENTER so she won't make an excuse: \"I'm ultying fucking Teemo!\". But again, watch out for Zephyr  LOOK OUT for Zephyr. Mal, Blit, Luci: pls Zephyr me WHILE Cho, Jinx, Ez, Miss: don't even think about it  ZEPHYR is given to Blit to play the mind game, since he will pull the one next to the zephyred, make it count  DROP LUCI and put in 2 Mystic (No LULU no win) if u need to fight STRONG magic gang  MYSTIC IN is not worth if their spell casters are not that STRONG, check their carry items first  FREE WIN if you can Fast 9/ Have a FON for 2 Mystic 4 Brawlaster/ 4 Brawlaster 3 Rebel (Asol) 3 Cyber (Ekko)/ Thresh 3 (0w0)       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **TL;DR -** sure, you might be lazier than I thought, but it's fine :)  1. EARLY: Should Go Flexible Round 3-2 To 6 And Roll Win Streak Stack Items Fast 8 2. MID GAME: Do Not Roll Too Much When Contested 3. LATE GAME: Always Best Jinx Beside Blit Miss Center Look Out Zephyr Drop Luci Mystic In Free Win       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  P.S: Help me correct this guide at some points if i'm wrong. Besides, still can't find how to win without Miss/ GP 2. If you figured it out, please let me know. Working on 20 Me, rebels games to Master bet. $50 shall be mine. Update guide is on progress.

{"title": "Rolling and levelling patterns - Eco like a Diamond Player", "author": "MIke_TFT", "selftext": "Hey all,  ed to talk about rolling and levelling patterns today as this is something I see a lot of people get horribly wrong when I'm playing in lower ELO games.  I hit diamond 4 in set 1 and diamond 3 in set 2, managed to hit plat in 33 games this set (65% top4 rate), it's only really a matter of time before I secure diamond again. I realise I'm still pretty trash at the game, there are far better players than me out there but this is for all those people hardstuck in gold and silver that   to get better.  Let's jump right into it:  Generally people talk about economy and try to break down how to eco well, but nobody talks about powerspikes nearly as much as they should in my opinion. Economy is just about having enough gold to hit your next powerspike when you need to.  There is one fairly standard levelling/rolling pattern that I followed through set 2:  - Naturally hit level 4 at 2-3 - Go 5 at Krugs - Go 6 at 3-2, roll down to 10-20 gold depending on how strong you are - Go 7 at 4-1, roll down to 10-20 gold, depending on how strong you are - Go 8 at 5-1, roll down to 10-20 gold (or all of it if you don't intend on hitting 9) - Go 9 as soon as you can once you find your final  , generally this is a lot more dependent on how strong your level 8 comp is and if you can make top4 with it or not.  This works in most scenarios as it's middle of the road, a lot of others will be hitting their powerspikes when they level, as rolling/levelling gives you a harder powerspike and you're more likely to catch someone out who is a slow roller or who didn't level but maybe should have. There are, however, other places you can level/roll at, this is highly dependent on your early game and if it's worked out for you but I have noticed a couple other rolling practices, one in particular has been working really well for me when the conditions are right and it's how I've managed to climb way more quickly than I have in past sets.  I'll talk about the hyperrolling breakpoints first, a lot of people are running celestial/protectors at the moment and are absolutely dominating with it. Stacking Xin and Morde as their carries and then filling out the rest of the comp with celestials, protectors, vanguard's and snipers. Let's look at how this one breaks down:  - Save to 50g as quickly as possible, best way to do this is to losestreak until Krugs, this also gives you priority picks on the first two carousels so you can usually get one of your Xin items here, buy every 1 or 2 cost that has either celestial or protector, vanguard's are great here too. Don't hold any 3 cost  s if they are costing you interest (you have to be really strong with yourself about this one, Ashe won't help you as much as you think) - Any gold you have over 50 should be rolled until you're one round from level 6, the round before you have level 6, roll down to hit your 3* Xin/Rakan/Morde, it's easy 8th if you don't hit any of them, Xin being the most important. If you hit 10 gold and don't have at least one 3* that you can stack with items you're not going to have a fun time, your best bet is just to try to eco back up and hope for the best but your HP is pretty low already, I've been there a few times and it ain't fun because you're underleveled, underpowered and you just burned all your econ. - Once you hit your 3* you can usually eco at this point, buying up the rest of the  s you need, and switch back to a more classic levelling/rolling pattern, you're just delayed in getting to 7/8/9 and you can't really roll too much gold either, but it shouldn't matter because you should be winstreaking at this point.  I'm sure other comps will work with this rolling pattern, it's just that nobody has really figured them out yet but generally anything with 2 cost carries will do well here.  The final method is the fast8 method, this is my favourite because it genuinely feels like I'm laying the beatdown on every other player in the game. This only really works if the conditions are right early game but it's still doable.  If you've highrolled the creep rounds and have a really strong team with decent items (3 cybers with an item each is my favourite, if you can get an early Zephyr it's huge), you can happily level to 4 at 2-1 and throw something beefy on to compliment the cybers, a blitz, a Morde or a Xin will work, but even better is a Graves to help beef Lucian up even more. You can go space pirates at 5 to help your eco along. This game is going to pretty much rely on you winstreaking to Krugs.  - Level to 4 at 2-1 - Level to 5 at 2-3 - Level to 6 at 3-1 (if winstreaking, otherwise wait til 3-2) - Your aim now is to get to 50g, if you're losing a lot you've made some bad decisions, you should be on 95+ HP still. - Put any gold above 50 into XP, don't go below 50. - You should hit level 7 towards the later rounds of stage 3 and level 8 around 4-1 to 4-3.  Once you hit 8, you can either continue to eco to 9 depending on if you're strong enough, if you're  ting to lose games, figure out if you have enough time to eco to 9 or if you might need to roll some gold to hit a powerspike and then level to 9. Generally I like to roll once I hit 8 otherwise it's kinda wasted potential as you're going to be seeing 5-cost  s before everyone else so rolling 50 gold while being the first to see all the  s is going to let you get exactly what you need late.  I can pretty consistently hit top4 with this approach, just by fielding the strongest board possible at every stage, it's very positioning/items based, and it's just a case of knowing how to do those things, this isn't the place to talk about how to do that as I could literally write a book on that stuff. I think every comp has its own levelling methods (as you can probably tell with this one it's been working well with some combination of brawlers/blasters and cybernetics) but there will definitely be other comps that you can do this with as well.  Deciding when to use each one is generally done in the early game, depending on your shop and items, but once you commit to one transitioning out is pretty difficult, so make sure you commit to the right one for the game you're in and you'll do great :)  Hope this helps someone, good luck; have fun!", "id": "fs9per", "num_comments": 18, "created_utc": 1585645869},

{"title": "How to Beat Rebels with Dark   | Jhin Carry Comp by Volc", "author": "Volc_Guy", "selftext": "Greetings Tacticians, my name is Volc and I am currently in Masters/(soon to be) GM. Last time, I wrote a guide on how to play Irelia carry - you can find that guide [here]  To celebrate hitting Masters, I'm writing another guide, this time about 6 Dark   Jhin carry. This comp has been gaining popularity recently, so I'd like to share some tips and tricks to play this comp successfully.  **Why This Comp Works**  Jhin innately has a ton of single target damage, which is great for bursting down carries like Asol and Gangplank before they can do too much damage to your team. Because Jhin hits so hard, Ruunan's Hurricane lets him essentially burst down two targets at once, and a two-piece celestial synergy is enough to let Jhin heal huge amounts of health per shot. Guardian Angel gives Jhin a second chance if he gets bursted down, and he will be able to heal back up to full very quickly, especially if a lot of Dark    s have died to buff Jhin's damage. Jhin will often be your last   standing, so these items and synergies give him the best chance to pull off 1v5 fights.  **Endgame Comp/Variations**  The final comp is always 6 Dark  , with the following  s:  * All 6 Dark    s (Jarvan, Morde, Lux, Shaco, Karma, Jhin) * Ashe * Lulu at level 8  However, in the midgame, it usually isn't correct to play 4 or 5 Dark  s if you don't have all 6 of them. Instead, play 4 Vanguards 3 Dark  s while waiting to hit all of your Dark    s:  * Any 4 Vanguards, but always using Mordekaiser * Jhin * Ashe * Lulu/Any celestial   at level 8  This variation is strong enough in the midgame, but lacks damage in the late game where you really need jhin to be able to one-shot enemy carries.  If you manage to get a Dark   spatula, you have the option to go for 4 Mystics at level 9:  * 5 Dark  s (Morde, Lux, Shaco, Karma, Jhin) * Ashe * Lulu * Sona * Soraka  This gives your comp exceptional survivability against Gangplank and Asol.  **Item Priority/Strategy**   You should pretty much only be going for Jhin items when possible. The ideal items for Jhin, in order of importance, are **Guardian Angel IE/Deathblade Ruunan's Hurricane**. Deathblade is ideal over Infinity Edge since it gives more consistent damage and doesn't get countered by Bramble Vest, but you'll often find it hard to make since you are already using a sword to make GA. If there aren't any Jhin items left on the carousel, try to make a **Morello** to put on Mordekaiser, as he is a very good carry for the early/midgame. All tear items go on Lulu, though I would never go for these until I have completed Jhin items.  **Early Game**  There isn't any specific early game comp that is necessary to play Jhin, but the easiest transition is through a Vanguard opener. **Mordekaiser** is a great   to carry through the early/midgame, especially with a Morello. You'll also   a DPS   like Xayah, Caitlyn, or Lucian to carry Jhin items. Otherwise, just try to econ as well as possible, and a perfect loss streak through stage 2 is often optimal if you can't find 2    s. Space pirates Consider holding a 1-  copy of Jarvan IV if it doesn't cost econ since it'll be hard to find him later in the game, but don't hold any of the 3-cost Dark  s in Stage 2.  **Mid Game**  Regardless of how Stage 2 went, you'll   to get to 50 gold as soon as possible, then spend all your excess gold leveling. If you're winstreaking, consider leveling to 6 at 3-2 if it leaves you at  40 gold. Stage 3 is all about balancing econ and health preservation - streaking matters much less once you hit 50 gold, so play your strongest board to preserve your health. At this point, you can hold 3-cost  s that fit in your final comp. 4 Vanguard is a great synergy to run in the midgame, as it is playable with Jhin before hitting 6 Dark  s. The goal is to hit level 8 at 4-3 with 30-50 gold to roll.  **The Roll-Down**  At 4-3, roll all of your gold to complete your comp. If you can't find all of the Dark    s, run 4 Vanguards instead. If you can't find Lulu, run another Celestial   instead - Celestial is more important than Mystic because Jhin really needs the healing to survive. Ideally, you'll hit 2-  Jhin; if you don't, there are a couple of options you can take. If you're low on health ( 30), you'll   to reroll to 0 gold each round to try to find Jhin 2. Otherwise, if you have enough health to spare, you can stay on 1-  Jhin until after the creep round, then roll again at stage 5-1. Once you hit all of your 2- s, you can  t to econ again. If you are uncontested on Jhin, consider staying on level 8 50 gold and reroll for Jhin 3. Otherwise, going to level 9 and putting in a strong 2-  5-cost like Miss Fortune or Gangplank is acceptable. If you have a Dark   spatula, aim to go to level 9 to put in 4 mystics.  **Late Game Positioning**  Right Side Jhin:    Left Side Jhin:    The key here is to position your Jhin away from damage threats, mainly Gangplank, Shaco, and Irelia. The Mordekaiser is positioned to bait GP away from Jhin: since GP centers his ult on the   he is currently autoattacking, you can get him to miss Jhin if you get him to target a   on the other side of the board. Lulu is placed near the backline to counter any Irelias or Shacos that jump on the Jhin - if only GP players are left, Lulu should be placed on the frontline instead to polymorph GP before he can ult.  **Conclusion**  Hopefully, this guide has been helpful in demonstrating how to effectively pilot the 6 Dark   comp. I am still new to writing guides, so I would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback on both the content and structure of the guide.

{"title": "4 Vanguards Jhin Stack comp Guide", "author": "kylelee6501", "selftext": "Just a warning beforehand: I am by no means a high elo player, but I've found this build to be quite effective, and learned it from watching high elo Korean streams and guides.     So this Jhin build is obviously a Jhin Stack, but the only synergy needed on him is Sniper Buff. As you may or may not know, Jhin is a popular and successful pick into Xin Zhao Protector Comps, so this comp does a fairly good job of beating those comps. Unlike other Jhin comps however (Chrono-Jhin, or Dark   Jhin), this team also holds itself quite well against the other comps (Chrono can feel meh at times and Jhin can easily be oneshot before Chrono stacks, and Dark   Jhin is way too high risk/high reward).  The Final Level 8 comp with item usually consists of: Jhin-IE/LW/GA Karma Ashe-Shojin Thresh/Lulu Mordekaiser Jayce Wukong-Morellonomicon/Zephyr Poppy/Leona  The must have items are Jhin's items, but if you can't get them, you can also swap out the GA or IE (if you must) for BT, Deathblade, or Runaan's. The Shojin on Ashe is based on preference and you can easily be put on Lulu if you prefer, and the Lulu and Thresh are interchangeable based on the enemy team comps.  If the enemy team is sorcs, Aurelion Sol stack, or GP stack, consider Lulu over Thresh so you don't get instantly bursted.  If the enemy comp is vangaurds, protectors, consider Thresh so Chrono buff gives Jhin some attack damage buff due to the drawn out fights.  Of course at level 9, you would   to have both Thresh and Lulu on, and just stack the bench with 5-cost champions for Thresh to pull in.  This strat is a Rush-8 strat, meaning you are required to roll as little as possible and put in gold into experience down to 50 gold. To maintain gold efficiency, you   to be maintaining a win or loss streak as long as possible (until Wolves is usually safe).   Early Game: You   to be putting your Jhin items on Caitlyn, and look to build a comp around her first. This means finding as many Poppys and Leonas for front line, getting Chrono buff with something like a Blitzcrank or Shen, or if you   to risk it, you can add Graves and Darius/Jayce for pirate buff.  Mid Game: You   to be looking for your Jayce 2  s, Wukong, Jhin and Ashe, so you can  t replacing your early game champions. If you are either losing too much health or you are one champion away from 2- ring the champions above, feel free to roll down to 30/40 gold as long as you have a decent win/loss streak.  Late Game: you   to have your Jhin and your front line at 2   now, and should be level 8. Depending on how much health you have at this moment, you need to make a decision of whether you   to push 9, or reroll to 2- /3-  your current comp. As for item carousels, you   to be looking for other champions items, such as zephyr, shojin and Morellonomicon. If you have safely hit level 9, decide whether you   to roll to 2   Lulu and Thresh, or whether you   to stock up the bench for Thresh to pull in.

{"title": "[GUIDE] Advanced guide on the best comps in meta: Rebel", "author": "Kiyoon", "selftext": " Hi, this is Kiyoon, currently rank 2 on NA.        You might know me as the player who got rank 1 from void sins and rank 1 from blender, and I'm here to write a guide on one of the best comps that I mostly played to climb to rank 2 NA (If there is interest, I might make a guide for protector mystic as well). I also stream almost everyday, so feel free drop by and ask questions.  For those that are unaware of me, I have a very distinctive high risk play style. I value lose-streaking and almost open fort (intentionally losing and selling almost every  s except key  s for maximum econ) every game, unless I have an insane  t that is guaranteed win streak. This open fort strategy is very risky compared to other play style and requires a bit of practice (krugs are scary). I value streaking and econ very heavily, as having more gold = increase in probability of you hitting the  s you need.  # 6 REBEL   [**   **General Notes:**  * Considered the best comp in meta as it uses almost all legendary  s really well, aside from ekko and thresh * Never roll a single time before level 8 (until stage 4-1 or 4-3 depending on econ/hp/lobby) * Key  s: asol with morello + tear item, gangplank with guardian angel and 5 rebel  s, miss fortune if you miss your asol or gangplank  **Early game (before krugs, 2-7)**  Two Options to make: win streak vs lose streak into krugs. It requires a lot of scouting to see how strong/weak you are relative to your lobby. This is probably the hardest part of the game and can only be learned through playing more games and seeing how strong/weak the boards are.   For example, if you have a malphite 2 + ziggs 2 with good item (seraph or morello) + 1 rebel  , you will most likely be strong enough to win streak all of stage 2 (again, this is relative to lobby, which is why scouting is crucial to streaking).   The reason why I prefer lose streaking over win streaking is because I can control it and almost guarantee it by intentionally playing weaker  s and not making items, whereas win streak is more based on who high rolls  /items early game (no control/guarantee). Key  s that are good vs krugs: vangaurds, shen, malphite, khazix or any random upgraded 1 cost  .  This is arguably the most important part of the game, as this comp requires going fast 8 to hit your legendary  s and to do that, you have to get to 50 econ to make maximum interest as fast as you can.  **Mid game (after krugs 2-7, before 4-3)**  As soon as you get to 50 econ, streaking is not super important (still important, but not as important as sub 50 econ). If you have been win streaking, you have two options:  1. If your board is very close to same strength as 1 or 2 other boards, you have the option to level  and play a strong value  , such as shen, ezreal, blitz, kayle or an upgraded  . If you have been winstreaking the entirety of stage 2, you would most likely be sitting at 50 gold, and should consider going down to 30 econ to level if it increases/guarantees your win streak.  2. If there is a board that you cannot beat no matter what or do not have a strong value   to play, you give up your win streak and stay above 50 gold, playing your strongest board.   Key  s that can save a lot of hp mid-game without losing econ are: guardian angel on rumble 1 solo front line for aoe demo stun, kayle 1, shen, blitz or ezreal (really easy to tech in 2 chrono trait, since all chrono  s are decent/good).  Unbroken lose streak scenario: If you have been lose streaking the entirety of stage 2 and 3, you are most likely at 30 ~45hp, which is scary. You are forced to all in at 4-1, leveling to 8 and roll it all down. Advantage: you can roll before other rebel players with lots of gold. Disadvantage: you are most likely at 2 or 3 lives and while on rolldown if you miss gp/asol completely, you are most likely going 8th.   Broken lose streak scenario: If you have been lose streaking the entirety of stage 2, but broken streak at stage 3 and above 50 hp, you level to 8 at 4-3 level and roll it down, all in.   **Late game (4-3, level 8 and onwards)**  Roll down at 4-3 or 4-1 in certain scenario is where it determines your placement depending on what you hit. Usually in most lobbies, asol 1 with good item and gangplank 1 with guardian angel, and mostly all upgraded rebel  s is good enough to go level 9. If you have bigger radius gangplank upgrade or double bomb upgrade on gp 1, it is stronger than gp 2.  Stage 4-3, you pick up all legendary  s aside from ekko and thresh. If you hit mf 2 or lulu 2, you are playing it at level 8. (even mf 1, you might play her with no items, if she ults, she is dealing 2k+ dmg).  **Late game positioning**  Right side:     Left side:    The most important part of rebel positioning is gangplank with guardian angel. You put it frontline center, so he is always the one getting focused first and ulting first. Gangplank 1 with guardian angel will always go off and cc the entire team. Make sure your gangplank never gets zephyred, and have a lesser important   like lulu or a single rebel   to eat the zephyr for him. The way gangplank ult ai work is, he ults the one he is autoing. So if your gangplank is closer to a wall attacking a  , his ult will probably not hit the entire enemy board.   Example of gangplank missing his ult through positioning and luck:     Here you can Kurum's gp getting lured to my karma (because his zeyphred my yi, which made karma the closest target for gp to walk to) and completely missing his ult to my rebel circle. This was a bit of positioning and mostly luck because of his zephyr and my yasuo ulting his gp to stall time to stay on the opposite side of my team.   Reason why you put lulu frontline is because the fights are short and burst damage from gangplank. In the mirror matchup where there is no initial burst before gp ult, lulu will almost only ult once in a fight and ults the closest target to her. Position her frontline so she takes damage and ults faster to impact the fight. If she polymorph's the enemy gp before gp ults, the fight is an instant win assuming similar item/upgrades. Lulu is almost always better frontline except vs infiltrator matchup, where you   her backline to be focused by shaco/kaisa to polymorph them.  Mf positioning should always be flexible, depending on lobby (infiltrator/blitz) and how much item you invested into her (if she should be protected or not). If your jinx does not have items and mf does not have items, there is no reason to run 2 blasters, you can run any celestial for the 2 celestial buff with lulu.   Against mirror matchup, you almost always   your gangplank to be directly infront of the enemy rebel circle. Becareful of shroud and zepyhr on gangplank.  **Key Items**  * Gangplank: gaurdian angel + any left over tank or mana item * Asol: seraph + morello + any ap item or dclaw  Any leftover items you can make: giant slayer (preferably on jinx, even if it's 1   as gs is not effected by   level), spark, zephyr, qss, bramble, trapclaw, redemption, thieves' gloves and shroud.   ------  This is the end of the rebel guide.

He isn't actually overpowered until he has the increased ranged on his ult, Infact I'd say he's underwhelming, all you have to do to counter a gankplank with no increased range is bait someone in the middle so that the ult goes in the middle of the board, put your carries at the sides, this way the ult won't reach your other champs/carries. even with gp level two, jewelled gauntlet, guardian angel and quick silver I wasn't able to win matches, the only time I actually  t winning vs other players is when I have a stacked back line or if my GP has the range upgrade.

{"title": "thatsPRIMAL's Challenger guide to 6 Cybernetics and soft countering the Rebel blight (illustration by Tacter)", "author": "thatsPRIMAL", "selftext": " [tldr image version ](  )  Hi! I'm still   Riot thatsPRIMAL  and I'm Challenger Set 2, currently top 1  on NA. I work at Riot but not on TFT! I posted two guides that people seemed to like (on my old account,  [FearGorm ](   )), so I'm back with another guide to 6 Cybernetics, which I believe has the tools to soft counter Rebels - the strongest build right now. If you're looking for a good guide to Rebels, JinxedJK already wrote one, so I won't be writing that! Volc _Guy wrote a great guide to Irelia carry, which uses similar principles. I have a different style and prioritization, so I'm sharing my approach with you. Take in as much information as you can from different guides, streams, and players, and synthesize your own approach that fits your playstyle.  I'll be posting guides periodically here, but you can also follow me on  [twitter.com/thatsPRIMAL ](twitch.tv/thatsPRIMAL).  I also stream almost daily at  [twitch.tv/thatsPRIMAL ]  so you can watch the build in action there and ask questions! I'll stream today at 730pm PT.  Finally, I've uploaded a video of me playing this build to my  [YouTube ](   )   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Core Principles**  * Lucian is one of the strongest 2-3 cost  s in the game due to his combination of elite mobility, range, and traits (Cybernetic and Blaster). Picking up a Lucian and itemizing him with 1-3 of his ideal items will allow you to either winstreak and aggressively roll and level well into Stage 4, or preserve HP while alternating wins and losses. and conservatively level. * 6 Cybernetic is one of the strongest traits in the game, granting **any cybernetic   with an item** (even if it's just a lone spatula) 80 AD and 8  HP. For comparison, an Infinity Edge (IE) grants 15 AD, and a Warmogs grants 4 HP. Those items have bonus stats too, but even taking that into consideration, 6 Cybernetics will be giving any cybernetic   with even a single item component 1-2 full items worth of value. That's nuts! * Irelia is a very item dependent carry, but with the right items, becomes an extremely potent carry who is easy to use as an anti-carry by utilizing precise positioning. She also targets **the   with the highest mana** after killing anyone with her ult, allowing her to reliably target Gangplank (150 mana max) and Miss Fortune (150 mana max). More on this later, in the positioning section. * You will be focusing on one of two things with your items for carries. Either:    * A: Collecting 1 item for Lucian out of Red Buff or Giant's Slayer, and looking to preserve HP, while not necessarily winstreaking. You will collect 2-3 perfect items for Irelia (Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Seraph's Embrace, Guardian Angel) and place them on Irelia as soon as you can get her.    * B: When you have a strong  t (early Lucian 2, early Cybernetics, etc.), collect 2 items for Lucian out of Red Buff, Giant's Slayer, and Runaan's Hurricane before making anything else. Then, you will collect 2 perfect items for Irelia. * Supporting items are important in this build:    * If you ever get a Rod, you will use that to make an Ionic Spark or Morellos (but not at the expense of Red Buff).    *  ting with Stage 3-6, you will prioritize finding a Shroud of Stillness (ideal) or Zephyr (good but not as good as Shroud) to beat the Rebels players. * Your carries in this build are Lucian and Irelia - Ekko is mostly there to complete your Cybernetic synergy. This is because Ekko often requires multiple items to carry and level 2 to be strong, and any spare items you have need to be distributed onto other cybernetic  s to activate the 6 Cybernetic trait. * You will likely stop playing Fiora and Leona at some point in stage 3 or 4 and opt for better  s. If you do, you **should not sell them**, as they will become increasingly rare as the game progresses and you don't   to be stuck with an Ekko but no Fiora or Leona. That said, you don't need to hold a 2   Fiora or Leona as they will cost you a lot of gold. You can hold a 1   version of each on your bench.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Strengths**  * Flexible early-mid game that makes good use of Rebels or Cybernetics on the way to 6 Cybernetic * Extremely efficient utilization of items due to free stats from Cybernetic. Even a spare spatula or belt can give you 80AD and 8 hp, making  s that would otherwise be weak late game (e.g. Fiora) relevant. * Has a good matchup into Rebels provided you position well and, ideally, have either Shroud of Stillness or Zephyr  **Weaknesses**  * Can be difficult to play - this is a build that requires a really strong understanding of how to transition items between  s. When learning this build, you may find yourself at points with too many items on the wrong   at the wrong time, and therefore unable to distribute your items amongst the rest of your cybernetics. For example, you don't   to be stuck at stage 5-1, at level 8, with a stacked Fiora, 6 Cybernetic, but no way to get the items off of Fiora and onto the other cybernetics without losing 6 Cybernetic * Very positioning reliant - if Irelia gets stuck on the  , or Vi is on the wrong side, or Shroud of Stillness is misused, or Zephyr is misused, your combat effectiveness goes down. * Reliant on finding Ekko. The early and mid game for this build are strong enough that you'll usually be able to build enough of an hp and mana reserve to get Ekko on time, but you will have the occasional game where Ekko just isn't available to you and you'll need to pivot.  **Pivot Options**  * Pivoting into 4 Blasters 4 Brawlers is the best option as often:    * You'll already have Lucian, who is almost as good of a carry as Jinx due to his safety.    * You'll already have Vi, who is a great  , and a brawler    * You'll   to pick up Ezreals, Graves, and Jinxes anyway along the way to help you make it through midgame    * You'll likely have Blitz because he's a very strong   and synergizes with Vi (Brawler) and Ez (Chrono)   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Key Items**  * Infinity Edge: The most important damage item for Irelia. I'm not 1 % sure but I believe that it's so good because Irelia's ult counts as an autoattack, and can crit. Irrespective of whether this is true, in my experience, Irelia performs best when she has this. * Guardian Angel: This is your insurance policy against CC and burst abilities that take Irelia out before she can clean up the enemy carries. Also gives her more attack damage, which her ultimate scales off of. * Bloodthirster: Will allow Irelia to heal rapidly in fights, and grants her magic resistance, which is helpful vs Rebels, who deal primarily magic damage. * Red Buff: A fantastic item for blasters. This was buffed from Set 2 and now does more damage (true damage) but reduces healing less. There isn't a ton of healing in the meta comps right now, so this is a net buff to Red Buff. Putting this on Lucian and getting at least 2 Blaster buff will allow him to comfortably carry the midgame. * Shroud of Stillness: Soft counters Rebels because Rebels need to be placed adjacent to one another, and Shroud increases the mana cost of everyone in a straight line. More on this in my post here:    Also good:  * Infiltrator Spatula: An awesome item on Irelia as it allows her to jump to the backline. The best use of spat in this composition. * Seraph's Embrace: This is the best use of tears in this comp by far. It enables both Lucian and Irelia  to continually ult, which allows him to dodge much more often, and ult more often. The reason this works so well on Lucian and Irelia is they both have small mana pools (35 for Lucian, 30 for Irelia), and Seraph's restores 20 mana, meaning they get back over 50% of their mana pool back every time they ult! * Giant's Slayer: Another fantastic item for Lucian when running blaster. I rate this lower than Red Buff because it uses a Sword, which you   to use for IE, BT, or GA, leaving very few swords for this item. Additionally, this item doesn't perform well vs vanguards. To get good value from this, you need to run at least 2 Blaster. * Runaan's Hurricane: Fantastic when paired with Giant Slayer or Red Buff due to the fact that Runaan's extra auto attacks also apply Giant Slayer and Red Buff to more targets. * Ionic Spark: An all around great item that deals damage to  s who ult while the Ionic Spark carrier is nearby. Throw this on a Vi, who is likely to ult the enemy carry (she ults the furthest enemy, who is often a squishy carry), and will pass through the entire team. Not as high of a priority as it is in other builds because Cybernetics aren't magic damage reliant, and one of the traits of this item is that it lowers the Magic Resistance of enemies. * Zephyr: Great if you can hit either Miss Fortune or Gangplank with it. I rate this lower than Shroud because late game, most players will move their MF and GP around constantly, making it hard to Zephyr them, and **Aurelion Sol cannot be Zephyred**. Due to the  ship  trait. * Hand of Justice: An all around good item that Irelia can make good use of, especially when she gets the damage buff. Somewhat redundant with GA and BT from a survivability perspective, which is why I don't rate it more highly.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Level 8 Comp**  * Early 8: 6 Cybernetics, 2 Chrono, 2 Vanguard, 2 Blaster (add Ezreal and Wukong to the 6 Cybernetics)    * This is what you'll have early in stage 5, before you can get a 2   Miss Fortune. Ezreal has one of the better ultimates in the game against Rebels - it's an area of effect ability that does good base damage and increases the enemy's amount of mana required to ult. Wukong is mostly there to just use his ultimate, provide a little extra tankiness, 2 Chrono synergy, and then die (sadmonkey). * Late 8: 6 Cybernetics, 3 Blademaster, 2 Valkyrie (add Kayle, Miss Fortune).    * Usually, you'll transition into this after the  Early 8  variant. The moment you hit MF 2, you should drop both Ezreal and Wukong so you can get Valkyrie buff empowering MF. * Note on 5 costs: You should avoid picking up Gangplank at all, as you likely won't have spare items to put on him, and he needs at least 2 completed items (Guardian Angel and a damage item) to be effective. Additionally, holding him in your shop will produce mercenary upgrades in one of the 5 shop spaces, hurting your chances of finding a   you'll need. * Lulu is an awesome 5 cost once you get her to 2  s, and should always be played at 2  . I don't believe a Lulu 1 is worth playing just for Mystics or Celestials, as her ult takes a long time to cast and won't be very high impact at level 1.  **What to prioritize on first carousel, in order of priority:**  1. Sword: IE, BT, GA and GS all build out of this item, so hoard as many swords as you can get! 2. Chain: Builds into Red Buff (the best Lucian item) as well as GA and Shroud of Stillness. Avoid building a Shroud until you already have the other items, as Shroud also uses a glove, which you'll need for IE. If you get 2 early chain vests, Bramble vest is not a bad option, as it can help you winstreak hard when placed on a tank like Malphite. 3. Cloak: Great for Ionic Spark, Zephyr, Runaan's, Bloodthirster.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Stage by Stage breakdown:**  Early Game (Stage 1 and 2)  1. You should try to make the strongest board you can. **Just because you're looking to run 6 cybernetics does not mean you need to run 3 cybernetics**. For example if you get an early Graves 2, a Lucian, and a random Malphite 2, you can just run that, hold a Fiora level in reserve on your bench, and play her later in the game when you just need her for 6 cybernetic. You could even run 4 Vanguards 2 Blasters (Ez/Graves+Lucian). Just play whatever you get that is strong midgame. 2. The strongest single trait openings are 3 Rebels and 3 Cybernetics, so have a bias toward that. Graves is also a solid   in his own right, and enables 2 blaster once you get Lucian. 3. Focus on either winstreaking by playing your strongest board (in which case, you may   to go 5 after this second carousel) or focus on making economy (in which case, you should stay at 4 until after Krugs).  Mid Game (Stage 3)  1. After Krugs, if you're not already level 5, go to 5. 2. At 3-2, if you're winstreaking, go to 6 to increase your chances of winning, and consider rolling if you have 2 or more pairs you   to make (for example, you have 2 Lucians and 2 Blitzes). 3. If you are not winstreaking, stay at level 5 and only go to 6 when it doesn't cost you money. 4. As always, scout, scout scout. Make sure your Lucian is safe from Blitzes, that your Blitz is set up to effectively pick out carries, etc. 5. Key  s that will really amplify your midgame, even at level 1 with no items, are Kayle and Jinx - take them and play them immediately to add power to your board. I avoid 2  ring either unless I really need them to protect HP. I usually 2   Kayle after I get MF 2.  Mid-Late (Stage 4)  1. Go 7 at 4-1, but do not roll unless you are both winstreaking and have pairs to complete. You   to go to 8 at 4-3 or 4-4 if Cybernetics are contested, and you'll   to be 8 with about 30 gold to roll finding Ekko. 2. If Cybernetics are not contested, you have good health (70) or so, and aren't at risk of taking huge losses that would leave you below 40hp at the end of stage 4, you can also wait until 5-1 to go 8 and roll.  Late Game (Stage 5)  1. If you haven't gone fast 8 and rolled down, then go 8 at 5-1 and roll down until you at least have Ekko 1 and Irelia 2. 2. At this point, refer to the ideal comps to see what  s to look out for. Don't overly tunnel on making the right board - instead focus on trying to predict who you will face in the next round so you can correctly position your Shrouds of Stillness and Zephyrs.  **Item Distribution** **with 6 Cybernetics**  1. The most important thing to note is that you should **usually  prioritize putting items on Cybernetics instead of your spare  s** (Ezreal, MF, Kayle, Wukong) because the Cybernetics unlock bonuses for having any item at all. 2. Late game, the only Cybernetic who is important to have multiple items is Irelia, who should have 2-3 completed items. By stage 5, Lucian won't be carrying hard anymore, and it's fine to sell a Lucian 2 and play a Lucian 1 if it means getting items he might have been carrying for Irelia (like Seraphs) on Irelia. 3. **Unless you can make a  key  or  also good  item, it is generally better to have spare item components across multiple Cybernetics** who don't already have items than a suboptimal item on an individual  . For example, I'd rather have a spare cloak on a Vi and a spare chainvest on a Fiora if they still don't have items, than a swordbreaker (cloak + chainvest) on a Lucian who already has items. This is because 80AD and 8 hp is on average better value than most of the suboptimal items. This also goes for spatula - I'd rather have an individual spatula on a Leona than try to make make a demolitionist spatula for this comp.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Win (1st places) Conditions:**  1. Stacked Irelia and Ekko 2 2. Stacked Irelia and MF 2 3. Stacked Irelia, Lulu 2, MF 1, and Good items 4. (vs Rebels) Stacked Irelia, either Ekko 2 or MF 2, and Shroud of Stillness used vs Gangplank   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Positioning:**  1. Put Shrouds and Zephyrs on Fiora or Leona so you can move your Zephyr and Shroud to the right position without jeopardizing your positioning. 2. Put Irelia **either**: near the weakest front liner so that she can kill them with ult and then she will ult to the target with the highest mana (usually a carry like GP or MF), or directly next to a Gangplank so she kills him, or on the far right or left corner, so she doesn't take too much damage. 3. Put Vi on the front line, either on the far right or on the far left, opposite the enemy carry you   her to ult. (So if there's a jinx on the back right, keep Vi front row far left). 4. Put Ekko on the 3rd row so he doesn't get accidentally Zephyrd). Technicall 5. Keep MF on the back line one hex from the left or righ", "id": "fnuu8a", "num_comments": 73, "created_utc": 1585 7649},

{"title": "How to counter Rebels with Shroud of Stillness, Zephyr, and positioning - tips and clips inside", "author": "FearGorm", "selftext": "Hey all - it's Riot thatsPRIMAL with a few tips (I should really change my reddit account) on how to beat Rebels with good items, with associated clips. I'm currently top 1  (rank 64!) on NA and have had success taking multiple 1st in Rebel lobbies with Cybernetics.  Rebel + Gangplank + Miss Fortune comps are super strong now and while they are hard to beat, I think they can consistently be beaten with a combination of very tight Cybernetics play, shroud of stillness, and zephyr.   Volc posting a good guide on the front page on Irelia carry that you should check out - I'm going to take a stab at a slightly different guide style using the same  s - you can expect that within 48 hours! In the meantime, here are some general tips. If you   a tldr, here are two clips showing how I deal with Gangplank:  1. Outplaying Rebels with Shroud:     2. Outplaying Rebels with Zephyr:          **Rebel Gangplank Comp Weaknesses**   - The primary weakness of this comp is very inflexible from a positioning standpoint - the rebels must be clustered together in order to activate their trait. This means rebels are very vulnerable to AOE abilities, especially ones that activate early in the fight, before rebels have a chance to separate.    - Gangplank is optimally positioning on the front line because he is a melee range  , this means it's usually very predictable where he is going to be placed, especially if he has a Rebel spatula item (because it means that he not only needs to be in the front, he needs to be clustered with his team).   -Gangplank is item dependent - he needs a GA and damage item (Ionic, Crit Gauntlet, Deathcap, etc.) to be effective. This means he's usually relatively squishy, and can be killed early before his ultimate activate, or (if he has GA), killed once before he ults, significantly delaying his ult, allowing your team to kill the rest of his team before he ults.  **Itemization and Positioning counters to this comp**  1. **Shroud of Stillness**. Shroud shoots out a beam that increases the mana cost to cast ultimates of all  s who are within that beam. **By lining up shroud of stillness with key  s on Rebels**, especially Gangplank, you can significantly delay their ult, and win a fight by having your team outright kill a gang 2. **Zephyr:** Most of you are familiar with this by now, but a front line Zephyr, when placed on a   you don't care about (so don't place it on an Irelia for example, try a Leona or Vi), can win you the fight if you use it vs an upcoming Gangplank. Try to have a replacement copy of a   ready so you can sell the   on the board with Zephyr, put a copy of it back in, and place your (now unbound) Zephyr on wherever the opponent moves their GP. If you're not sure where the opponent is going to move GP to, place  s with available items slots in multiple spots that the opponent is likely to move GP to. Example here:     3. **Ezreal:** Ezreal has one of the best ultimates in the game for a 3-4 cost: it's basically an AOE poison/shroud of stillness. Throwing an Ezreal in vs Rebels will often get you an ultimate that delays the ultimate of 3 or more enemy Rebels  4. **Carry positioning:** Try positioning your carries opposite the gangplank so that they focus him down as quickly as possible. For example, if you're running Irelia, place her directly next to him so that she focuses him down quickly. 5. **Mana reaver:** Splashing in mana reaver on a   like Thresh and Irelia, and placing Thresh or Irelia near GP, will hugely delay his ult, and in many fights, prevent him from ulting at all, even if he has GA. You can accomplish this with 2 mana reavers, no need for more.", "id": "fmx3eu", "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1584868390}, 
{"title": "How To Beat (Almost All) Rebel Comps | Irelia Carry Guide by Volc", "author": "Volc_Guy", "selftext": "Greetings Tacticians, Volc here with my first ever TFT Guide. In this guide, I'll be talking about how to comfortably top 4 in a meta infested with Rebel comps, using Irelia as your main carry. For context, I'm  writing this guide after reaching Diamond with a 60% top 4 rate, with the last stretch of my climb being primarily Irelia comps. You can check my lolchess here:    .  **Ideal Irelia Items**  The most important item on Irelia is **Infinity Edge**, as this allows her to one-shot squishies and get her resets off. Next up is **Bloodthirster**, which allows her to heal up every time she ults to keep her in the fight for longer. Finally, **Guardian Angel** is the best third item for Irelia, as it allows her to drop aggro when she dies and heal back up afterwards with Bloodthirister. Alternative items are **Hand of Justice** in place of Bloodthirster, which trades consistent healing for sometimes more damage, and **Seraphs** in place of Guardian Angel, which trades longevity for quicker burst.   **Endgame Comp Variations**  There are a couple of variations that I build towards depending on the  s and items I hit. The simplest one is **6 Cybernetics 3 Blademasters**, which has the following  s:   - All 6 Cybernetic  s   - Kayle   - Kai'sa/Lulu/Gangplank  I usually go with this variation if I hit an early Ekko and have decent AP items to put on him. Kai'sa goes in if I have good Kayle items; otherwise, I try to hit a Lulu 2 or GP 2. If I get GP, the level 9 add is usually a Demolitionist  .  The other variation I've been testing out recently is **3 Cybernetics 4 Brawlers 3 Blademasters**, which has the following  s:   - All 4 Brawlers   - Irelia   - Fiora   - Kayle   - Miss Fortune  I will aim for this composition if I see most of the lobby going for rebels, as the AOE CC and damage from Cho'Gath, Kayle, and Miss Fortune is often enough to win fights against all but the strongest of Rebel comps. At level 9, I either add Lulu 2 or Gangplank 2.  **Carousel/Item Strategy**  Sword   Glove   Cloak   Rod   Vest  Since the ideal Irelia items need **3 swords**, that's what we'll be going for on most of the carousels. Try to complete the ideal Irelia items in order of their importance - IE is absolutely essential, so don't go slamming your only sword on a Bloodthirster or GA if you don't have an IE yet. If you're getting a lot of tears, consider going with Seraph's as a third item instead of GA. After getting your Irelia items, or if you can't get one of the Irelia item components on the carousel, you generally   to go for a **Morellonomicon**, which either goes on **Cho'Gath** or **Ekko** depending on the variation. **Kayle** items are also very good, with the priority being **Rageblade   Gunblade   RFC**. In general, spare Rod items go on Ekko while spare Bow items go on Kayle. **Thief's Gloves** are fine to put on **Vi** if you're getting too many gloves, and utility items like **Zephyr** and **Cloak of Stillness** should go on Cyber  s without items. Cloak of Stillness is especially good against Rebel players as they clump up their  s.  **Early Game (Round 2-1 to 3-1)**  The early game is all about having one DPS   to carry Irelia items while the rest of your team consists of tanks. There's absolutely no reason to reroll at all in Stage 2 - just play with the  s you're given and winstreak/losestreak accordingly.  The ideal opener is **3 Cybernetics** with Lucian, Fiora, and Leona. Lucian will carry Irelia items, but don't hesitate to put single item components on Fiora and Leona to maximize the efficiency of the synergy. With this opener, I like to add **Vanguard** at level 4 and **Blaster** at level 5. Since you'll need to get the items off of those Cybernetic  s eventually, try to hold on to 1-  versions of each so you can swap them in when the time comes.  The other two good Irelia item carriers are **Xayah** and **Caitlyn**. With Xayah, aim to get 3 Blademasters with Fiora and Shen, and add Blitzcrank and Malphite at levels 4 and 5 for Chrono and Brawlers. Xin Zhao and Rakan are also fine for Celestial. With Caitlyn, you can play any frontline like Vanguards or Brawlers, though you should try to get the Chrono synergy with either Blitzcrank or Shen.  In either case, if you are in a position to winstreak, level aggressively by going level 4 on 2-1 or 2-2 and level 5 on 2-5. Make sure to scout for Blitzcranks so your carry doesn't get hooked. I sometimes like to purposefully lose before the Stage 2 carousel to get a priority pick on a Sword if I'm lacking Irelia items. However, winstreaking is generally the optimal strategy, as it lets us coast through the mid-game with a high health total. I'll also try to hold or use Brawler  s if I see many players going Rebels and if Brawlers are uncontested.  **Mid Game (Round 3-2 to 4-3)**  If you can hit 2-  on your DPS  , you're often in good shape to winstreak through most of Stage 3. Again, you usually shouldn't reroll at all during Stage 3, as our goal is to get to level 8 as soon as possible. However, if you're winstreaking, rerolling once or twice at level 6 can be a good idea if it nets you an important synergy or 2- s.  Level to 6 at 3-2 if winstreaking and 3-4 if losestreaking. Try to field your strongest board even if you're losestreaking, as you'll need all the health you can get for Stage 4. You'll   to stay above 50 gold for maximum interest and use all excess gold to level here - the goal is level 8 with 40-50 gold at round 4-3. If you're able to hit this goal with about 50 HP to spare, you're in a good position to top 2. Otherwise, if you find you're bleeding too much health in Stage 3, I would consider rolling at level 7 on round 4-1 to stabilize. In this case, you're usually looking to scrape by with a 4th place. Leveling to 8 on round 4-6 is also acceptable if you have enough HP but not enough gold.  **Late Game (Round 4-3 Onward)**   If all has gone to plan, you'll be level 8 with 40-50 gold at round 4-3. Here, you should roll all of your gold to complete your comp - Irelia 2 is obviously the most important. Replace your Cyber  s that have items with the 1-  versions you've been holding on your bench.  This comp should be able to beat most of the other comps that you encounter, with the exception of an ideal Rebel comp with Lulu 2, GP 2, and Asol 2. You'll often get 2nd with this comp - 1st place is usually that perfect Rebel comp.  Positioning is key in the late game - sniping  s with Zephyr or Shroud of Stillness can often be the difference between winning and losing a round. Make sure to position your backline to avoid Blitzcrank hooks and Infiltrators, and position your Irelia so she doesn't dive straight into a Lulu ult or a tanky   that will take too long to kill.  **Conclusion**  Hopefully, this guide has been useful in demonstrating how to effectively use Irelia as a carry. As this is my first time writing a guide, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, both on the content and the formatting of this guide.

I work at Riot but not on TFT, I'm just a fan of the game. Many of you will be experiencing Set 3 for the first time today so to help you get that valuable LP I've put together a guide to one of my favorite family of compositions, Vanguard carries. If you   to see it in action, check out my stream at twitch.tv/thatsPRIMAL - I stream almost daily and I'm online now. I'm going to also post a guide on 6   guardian 4 sorc, and a guide to Lucian cybernetic carry this week if people like this kind of content.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Core Principles**  * Get 4 Vanguards (Jayce, Mordekaiser, Wukong and Leona/Poppy) ASAP to unlock the massive 250 armor bonus, which will allow you to outright win vs most comps midgame, and minimize the health loss when you lose. * Focus on 3  ring Jayce and Morde: Because it is the beginning of set 3 and there aren't as many unique champions as there were at the end of Set 2, it is much easier to get 3  s of champions in general. * Play space pirates alongside your vanguards levels 3 through 7 to accumulate a huge gold advantage that allows you to either 3   Jayce, 3   Morde, or go 8 without a huge cost to your economy. * Prioritize items that deal damage over time for Morde, or damage + sustain items on Jayce, to win fights. * Roll at 6 to hit Morde 3 and Jayce 3.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Strengths**  * Utilizes most items very well * Reliably strong midgame and strong econ due to pirates and core  s (Jayce, Morde) being easy to 2   * Strong vs infiltrators and snipers due to high armor * Fun as hell - watching Jayce 1 shot 3  s at once will never get old. He's like sorcerer Aatrox from set 1.  **Weaknesses**  * If you force Jayce 3 and Morde 3 when other people are forcing, you could end up in a 6th or 7th place scenario (see below for alternatives to Jayce 3 and Morde 3). * No backline access without infiltrator Jayce or clever Jayce positioning means this comp can struggle vs blasters (who generally deal percentage or true damage).   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Key Items**  * Gunblade: In my opinion, this is the best Jayce item. This will not only give Jayce more damage, it will also help him stay alive longer to get fight-changing ults off. The reason this works better on Jayce than other  s is he has huge armor with 4 Vanguard, so every point of health he regains will be worth more than it would be on low armor  s - it takes more damage to kill a 1 0 hp   with 3  armor than a 1 0 hp   with 50 armor. * Morellos: Very good item on Morde due to the area of effect nature of his ult and the fact that he stays alive so long, meaning he's constantly reapplying the true damage and healing debuff. * Ionic Spark: This item was updated in set 3 to also reduce the MR of enemy  s by 50%. That's huge, and synergizes perfectly with Morde and Jayce because both of their ults deal magic damage. Prioritize putting this on Morde, as he is the   who will likely live the longest. It's ok on Jayce, just not as good. * Dragon's claw: Set 3 has abundant magic damage (even from sources you might intuitively think of as dealing physical damage, like Jinx or Kaisa). Putting this on a vanguard, who already has a massive amount of armor, will greatly boost survivability against all comps. Put this on Jayce or Morde. * Deathcap or Jeweled Gauntlet: Great items for Jayce - either one will allow him to consistently one shot even frontliners. * Bramble Vest: An amazing early game item for snowballing. Put this on Morde since he's very tanky and will reflect a lot of damage as the fight goes on. Synergizes well with Ionic since Ionic reduces magic resistance and bramble is a magic item.  Also good:  * Titan's Resolve: Morde will stack this every fight because he's usually the last man standing - getting extra damage and resistances will allow him to clean up fights fairly reliably. Also good on Jayce (just not as good as sometimes you will   to position Jayce to avoid damage, meaning he won't stack Titan's Resolve). * Guardian's Angel (GA): Decent on Jayce as an insurance policy against burst spells that might kill him before he can heal off of gunblade. I think it falls off once he reaches 3  s, as he'll already have so much health, armor (and if you get dragon's claw, MR) that he will rarely die early anyway. * Shojins: Amazing on Ashe and Lulu - this will make them CC bots who can carry your team with utility. Not bad on Jayce or Morde, but you'll   to prioritize other items for them, and you won't   a Shojins stuck on a Jayce or Morde that you cannot sell. * Runaans: Good on Jhin (if he has Infinity Edge) or Ashe/Lulu (if she has Shojin's). Jhin will add a lot of damage from this addition, Ashe/Lulu will add a lot more CC, as it will act as a second Shojin's. Also note that on Set 3, Runaan's additional attack deals 70% of the original autoattack's damage, up from 60%. The difference is significant, try it yourself! * Infiltrator Spatula on Jayce: OP if you can get him, makes Jayce an assassin who can bypass the front line and 1 shot the backline. Not easy to get because reliant on spat, but perhaps the best Jayce item (sort of like Olaf from set 1).   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Level 8 Comp**  There are 3 ideal variants of this comp, and all of them involve 4 Vanguards  * 4 Vanguards (Jayce 3, Morde 3), 4 Celestials (Lulu, Ashe, Kassadin, Rakan)    * Based on my experience, this is the strongest variant of the comp - the huge healing buff will mean that Jayce is healing back to full with each ult (especially if he has gunblade), and Lulu and Ashe are amazing  s who will constantly be applying CC, giving Morde and Jayce time to do work. Kass is also a reasonably strong   who applies additional CC. If you don't have Lulu, Xin or Xayah are fine placeholders. If you run this, I highly recommend putting a dragon's claw on Jayce to deal with not having magic resistance. * 4 Vanguards, (Jayce 3, Morde 3), 4 Mystics (Lulu, Soraka, Karma, Sona)    * This is also very strong but less consistently achievable since it relies on finding Lulu. There are only 4 Mystics so if you don't find Lulu, you cannot run it, whereas there are 6 Celestials to choose from. * 4 Vanguards (Jayce 2, Morde 2), 2 Snipers (Jhin, Ashe 3), Miscellaneous (for example, you can add a Lulu and Soraka for Celestials and Mystics).    * This is what you run if you see that you're not going to be able to 3   Morde or Jayce because they're too contested. Ashe with Shojin + Runaan's (and another Shojin if you can get it) will constantly stun teams, and if you get her to 3  s, each of those ults will do 7  damage per  !    * If you happen to get items for infinity edge, Jhin can also hard carry your team, but be mindful of enemy Infiltrators and Blitzcranks!  **What to prioritize on first carousel, in order of priority:**  1. Rod: Builds into 4 key items: Ionic, Morellos, Deathcap, Jeweled Gauntlet. Ionic can snowball early rounds, so build it ASAP. 2. Cloak: Builds into 2 key items: Ionic and Dragon's claw 3. Chain: Builds into Bramble (best), Titan's Resolve or GA 4. Belt: Significantly worse than Rod or Cloak, but still decent. Can build Morellos which is key. Warmogs isn't bad on Morde, and Redemption is good on one of your noncarry Vanguards. Redemption has been reworked and is much better than old Redemptions - it heals your entire team when the Redemption carrier dies and has no cast time. Don't put this on Morde or Jayce, as they'll survive until the end.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Stage by Stage breakdown:**  Early Game (Stage 1 and 2)  1. If you can make an ionic spark or bramble, make them immediately - they can allow you to win rounds outright. Ionic is great on infiltrators since they generally get to carries, and then when the carries ult, they take damage. Bramble should go on a tank, like malphite. You   this item to get onto Morde, so if you don't have to put it on a Leona or Poppy, don't, since you don't   to have to sell a 2   Poppy/Leona to itemize Morde. 2. Pick up Graves or Darius so that you can  t snowballing a gold advantage the moment you get Jayce. You can also just run both Graves and Darius, but keep in mind that you'll   to sell one of them the moment you get Jayce, so it's potentially wasteful. I prefer Graves over Darius - his ult is more reliably impactful, he costs less, and has blaster, which is amazing with an early Ezreal or Lucian. 3. Scout the lobby for infiltrators and Blitzcrank's, and consider throwing a Vanguard in your back line to bait them.  Mid Game (Stage 3)  1. If you already have a pair of Jayce 1 or Morde 1s, consider going to 6 and rolling down to 0 at 3-2 to get them to 2  . Ideal comp here is 4 Vanguards (including Jayce and Morde), 2 Pirates (Jayce + Graves or Darius), and another strong individual   from earlier (Blitz, Lucian, Kaisa, Ashe). 2. At 3-2, you should be strong enough to winstreak, and even if you don't winstreak, you'll be getting an average of 2-3 gold per round from pirates, which is huge - that's the equivalent of winning 2-3 rounds! 3. If you rolled down to 0, econ back up to at least 30 gold before you  t rolling again. 4. SCOUT! If you see too many other Mordes or Jayces, you may need to pivot to Ashe+Jhin carry. In my opinion, 2 players can afford to go Morde 3 without cannibalizing each other 2 much,, and 1 player can afford to go Jayce. This is the really skillful part of the game, and games are won or lost by the decision you make. I could easily write a whole post about scouting, economy and comp selection, but this is already long enough, so here's a short primer on how to think here. Consider:    1. How many other players currently have Jayce or Morde    2. Whether those players look like they actually plan on holding Jayce and Morde, or are just playing them for a little while as they pursue another comp. (For example, if they have a Jayce 2 but the rest of their  s are sorcerers, they probably are going to sell Jayce, and maybe it's worth waiting until they do that to roll).    3. Do you have enough gold to pursue Jayce or Morde 3? If you rolled down at 3-2 and still don't have at Morde 2, you're probably not getting Morde 3 any time soon, same goes for Jayce.  Mid-Late (Stage 4)  1. Stay at 6 until you get Morde 3 or Jayce 3. If it looks like you're not going to hit them, consider holding Ashe for Ashe 3 instead. 2. Go 7 (if looking for Jayce but already have Morde 3) between 4-1 and 4-5, and finish either Jayce or Morde 3 (ideally both). If you get one but not the other, but are close to the other (say you have 7 Mordes), stay at 7 until you get the second 3  .  3. Go 8 once you hit Jayce and Morde 3 OR go 8 if you only have either Jayce or Morde 3, but got a Lulu at 7. You'll go 8 because you can run 4 mystics immediately, which is a big power spike. In some games, you may even   to just run Lulu+Ashe+1 Mystic+4 Vanguards at 7, it really depends on your health and gold relative to the lobby.  Late Game:  1. Hopefully by this point you already have Jayce 3 and Morde 3, and are just looking for Lulu, which gives you the strongest variant of 4 Celestial, or 4 Mystic.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Win (1st places) Conditions:**  1. Morde 3 and Jayce 3 2. Morde 3 or Jayce 3 and Ashe 3 3. Morde 3 or Jayce 3 and Lulu 2 with at least 1 Shojin;s. 4. Note that with just a Jayce 3 or Morde 3, you can top 3 with good items.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  **Positioning:**  1. Frontline your Vanguards, with Morde and Jayce in the middle to maximize the impact of their area of effect abilities 2. (2 IQ only): If you know who you're about to face, place Jayce on the far right or far left so he runs past the front line and one shots the backline. 3. Vs infiltrators + mech pilots, backline your vanguards so they kill off the infiltrators and don't get stuck on the gundam.", "id": "fl0pd8", "num_comments": 111, "created_utc": 1584578542},

{"title": "A few tips for those still trying to climb in set 2", "author": "Skelturix", "selftext": "Hello Reddit,  Today I (finally) made it to masters after close to 4  games played on this set [(here's my lolchess profile)]  I didn't know anything about TFT prior to this set (I didn't play set 1) and reading this sub on a daily basis helped me tremendously. Here are a few tips that I used to get to where I'm at, that will hopefully help you as well during the last few days of set 2 left.  **If you're plat or below:**  * **Force one comp or two every game**, ideally easy ones so that you can focus on transitioning rather than be there wondering whether or not you should be rolling, and what for. I would strongly recommend mages and shadow, they use similar items so depending on what you get you can go for either of these. There are more detailed guides for these comps on this sub but here's a few tips.   If you play mages, I'd recommend stacking someone that is not a mage, like Zyra or Neeko, until you find Brand; if you stack Syndra, you'll end up having to sell your 2 * Syndra to move the items over to Brand, which isn't optimal. Ideal items are 2x Deathcap (only build Morellos if there's a strong light player) + 1 mana item (Seraph Shojin) for Brand, GA on Malphite, and whatever remains for the others (Zephyr, Thieves Gloves being the best secondary items). If there's heavy CC in the enemy team, QSS can be a viable option for Brand so that you're sure he'll ult. Don't go 6 mages unless you get a spatula and mage Malphite. If you don't get this, it's better to do 3 mages and then splash mystic / 4 wardens at lv8-9 depending on what you're facing. Try not to roll before level 7, ideally around 3-4. If your midgame carry (Zyra / Neeko etc) is strong enough and your comp is not contested, hold till lv8 before you roll so that you have better chances of finding Brand, Malph and Nami.   If you play Shadow, stack Kindred - many items are viable on her: HoJ, Deathcap, Spellcrit, IE, RFC, Seraph, Guinsoo, all these items will work. Try to get a couple of Zephyrs so that you can get rid of their frontlane to proc shadow faster. Early game go Lunar + Shadow (ideally Kindred Sion Malz), only transition to 6 shadow once you find Yi, and be sure to get to at least level 8 before you try to find him or you'll waste gold. In the mean time you can splash summoner + inferno with Zyra Annie, or rangers inferno with Varus + 1 inferno, or mystic + cloud with Yasuo and Janna, there are many viable options there. Unless you got an especially strong board, I advise you to naturally level to 4, level to 5 for golems only if you can't win at level 4, then level to 6 on 3-2 and roll down for Kindred Sion Karma (you ideally   all of them 2  s when you're done rolling - if you don't find everyone, stop rolling and get back to 50 gold and roll again after raptors when you level to 7).  **If you're diamond+:**  * **Adapt your playstyle to what you're given.** Depending on the items and the shop you get, try to build a team accordingly (here's an example to illustrate my point, if you have 2 bows and 2 BF swords after creeps, it's probably a bad idea to   to go mages). You don't need to know every comp that exists, but try to learn complementary ones so that no matter the items or shop you get, you can work with those to build a comp that will do okay. This will avoid you getting 8th too often, which really hurts your climb (and your mental). * **Know the carries, and when they fall off.** From experience, you should have a decent idea of what combinations of characters and/or items are strong - use this knowledge to your advantage and try to spot when you can go for it. For example, if you're rolling with in mind to get shadows, and you currently have a Braum Nasus frontline, if you  t seeing Ezreals, buy them instead and switch to Glacial. The second part of this point is that people will sometimes try to transition too early, ending up dismantling a team that could have let them winstreak for a while longer, and replacing it with a worse version of it, because they sold several 2  s 1 or 2 cost  s for 1   4 cost  s. Learn to gauge how strong your team is relative to the lobby, and don't transition until you see you're falling off - or unless you see someone else is going for your comp, and you need to be there first to get key  s before they do.   The strategy I try to use most of the time is to go for Guinsoo / HoJ, item wise, and then try to always aim for these guys when I get to level 6 and roll down at 3-2: Ezreal, Azir, Qiyana, Kindred. I'll try to 2   either one of these 4 and give them the items, making them my midgame carries. Then I'll build my comp around them. These champions can usually be kept for the rest of the game, but you'll need a secondary carry later on (it can be Yasuo if you went for Azir, Zed or Olaf if you went for Ezreal, Kha if you went for Qiyana, Yi or Ashe/Twitch if you went for Kindred, etc). * **Don't build niche items too soon, but don't wait too long to use items either, even if the result is suboptimal.** This doesn't apply to all items obviously, but stuff like Morellos, Luden's, Ionic Spark, Statikk, Shojin are only actually good on a handful of champions - if you build those before getting the champion and the comp that goes with it, you might harm yourself in the long run. Conversely, if you're unsure of what item to build, or you know what item you   and you're missing a component, and because of that you don't use your items, you'll lose health unnecessarily. Yes, you might get the other half of your perfect item at the next carousel, but you might not get it if it's not there or if someone else takes it - don't wait too long before using your items. Here's a list of items that you can build and make a good use of in most cases: GA, Guinsoo, Zephyr, Thieve's Gloves, HoJ, Bramble Vest, Dragon's Claw. Don't hesitate to equip items even early on, on 1 cost or 2 cost  s that you know you'll sell later on, and try to put them on  s that benefit from the items - for example, GA and HoJ on Warwick, Guinsoo on Neeko, AP items on Zyra, GA/Bramble/Redemption on Nasus, etc).  **General tips that everyone can benefit from:**  * **Focus on keeping a healthy economy**, and fight off the \"must refresh syndrome\", especially if you have no idea what you're looking for. I know this is hard, I often find myself rolling if I stop thinking about what I'm doing, but this is essential and by simply having a stronger economy you'll be able to win by either outscaling your opponents, or just not falling behind because you rolled at level 6 for Brand and Nami, didn't find either, and currently have 0 gold while the rest of the lobby is level 7 with 30 gold. Don't underestimate the gold you gain from hitting an interest level by selling a  , even if it means buying this   again later on (of course, don't do that if it's a 5 cost   that you need, but for 1 to 3 cost  s it can be worth considering). * **In the late game, adapt your team to who you're facing.** When it's down to 4 players or less left, adapting your team and putting in cloud / warden or mystic depending on what you're facing will often make the difference between ending up at 4 and getting 1 or 2. It won't always work, sometimes your opponent will just be stronger than you, either because they highrolled or because their comp simply counters yours, but it won't always be true, so be on the lookout for that. * **Look for Zephyrs.** This can be hard to keep a track of it, especially when everyone is still alive, but try to avoid having your carries get hit by a Zephyr. This can cost you a fight and a lot of health, especially later on in the game. For people who can afford doing this without affecting their train of thought for team building, try to predict who you'll play against next (usually someone you haven't met in a while) - this makes it easier to dodge Zephyrs (or to hit your own Zephyrs, if you have some). * **Pay attention to your positioning.** Dodging Zephyrs is part of this, but you should be careful of how you're positioning your team as it can make you win fights. Multiple players in the lobby have assassins on the right side of the map? Place your carry accordingly and put a bait   to keep the assassins busy while your carry kills them. Be mindful of Karma positioning, you don't   her shielding your Leona instead of your Azir. Enemy is playing Berserkers? Put your carry on the other side of where Olaf is, or he'll get stunned by the glacial cleave. Etc, etc. * **Have a good team balance.** If you only focus on buying and  ring up carries, but have a shitty frontlane (item-less 1   Nasus + 1   Leona protecting 2  s Ashe Twitch Kindred Varus with items for example), the enemy team will get to your carries before they get a chance to  t dealing damage. You need to spread your focus on frontlane and backlane according to how your team works (some teams don't need frontlanes as solid as others, for example Shadow will only have Sion and Leona because they have a huge damage output, while other teams like Rangers need more time to get online and so need stronger frontlines to buy them time to ramp up their damage). This also means it's often better to stack someone on the frontline than to only stack the backline (of course, if you only have tears and bows, make more Statikks for your Ashe, don't build RFC and Seraphs on Braum, but if you have 2 BFs and 1 vest, it's probably better to get Taric or Malph a GA than to give Twitch a Deathblade). * **Don't get baited by theoretical best comp.** What I mean by this is, it's sometimes better to pass up on a   than to force it in your comp. It's not because the spreadsheet says that mage team needs Malphite mage and not Annie mage that your 2  s Annie should be replaced by a 1   Malphite. You can buy the Malph and keep it until he's 2  s, but if you  t replacing all your 2  s by other characters at 1  s just because \"they fit better\" it won't work. You need to always keep in mind whether or not replacing a   will actually make your board stronger. If it won't, either wait until it does, or simply pass up on the   and branch out to some other synergy. To continue on my example of Annie vs Malph mage, you can pass up on Malph and go for Amumu instead - you'll have 3 inferno with Annie mage, boosting her damage as well as Amumu's and Brand's, because of the inferno trait.   Related to this point, some  s need specific items to work - don't buy them if you don't have the items. This is especially true for 5 cost  s such as Zed and Yi. * **Don't blame the RNG, blame yourself.** Before you  t insulting me, I know RNG is involved in this game and I know sometimes you simply lowroll and don't find the Zed or Taric or Singed you need even when rolling 60 gold at lv8 and being uncontested, while this guy rolls 20 gold at lv7 and finds Singed 2 *. It happens. But your focus should be on what YOU can do to improve your play, always. Maybe you should have stopped rolling after rolling 30 gold without finding anything, and kept the other 30 to get back to 50 gold quickly and then either looked to get to lv9, or slow roll and hope for better luck. Or maybe you should have bought some other 4 cost   instead and played with it, or maybe bought that crystal Lux even if you have no crystal in your team and try to play around this instead. RNG can mess with you, but you should always be focused on trying to play with what you're given, instead of what you  . * **Don't play if you're not going to try your best.** I'm guilty of this, but sometimes I'll just be there playing without actually being focused on the game and end up losing all the progress I made the day before - at the time I'm doing it, I couldn't care less, but looking back, I've just wasted time twice - today because I went top 8 three times in a row, but also yesterday's time because I just undid all my work. Try to refrain from doing this - ideally go do something else, like take a nap or go outside (maybe not with coronavirus), and if you really   to play TFT play normals, or create a smurf and play ranked there instead. I have wasted hours upon hours because of that, don't be like me! This is especially important as set 2 is coming to an end.

{"title": "Cybernetic Mech Pilot Inflitrators - A Set 3 Guide", "author": "MIke_TFT", "selftext": "So I've been messing around in the PBE just like everyone else trying to figure out what's strong ahead of time. I've stumbled across a comp that seems to work for me pretty consistently.  6 cybernetic / 3 mech pilots. This is an eco-heavy comp that involves rolling mostly at 8/9. Due to the economy and damage changes, it makes more sense to eco through the midgame while making high value plays that allow you to mitigate HP loss and come out fighting in the late game. Cybernetic is super high value, as you can slam just about any items onto your champs and get massive benefit out of them.  So, what does your final build look like?  - Ekko - Irelia - Fizz - Rumble - Vi - Lucian - Annie - Leona - Fiora  Early in the game I like to open with 3 cybernetic / 2 space pirate, you can get blaster with Lucian/Graves, this allows you to eco even harder and get to 8 that much quicker. I prefer Jayce over Darius early, his damage is much more consistent, Darius can just get bursted down or ult at really bad times sometimes, so Jayce is definitely my preferred pick. You can stack AP items on Jayce, you're going to sell him later to put Ekko on the board, he's just a placeholder for now.  You   to buy mech pilots that you see in the shop, but don't play them unless they make your board stronger. You need to be slamming one full item on each of your cybernetics, so prioritise them. Do not put items on your mech pilots.  Leona - Bramble Vest / Zephyr / GA Fiora - Bramble Vest / Zephyr / GA Lucian - Seraphs / Stattik / Zephyr Jayce - Ludens / Deathcap / Jeweled Gauntlet / Anything AP/Mana Mech Pilots - No items Graves - No items  In the early game, make sure you fully weigh up your options, if it makes sense to go 4 at 2-1, do it. If it makes sense to go 5 at 2-5, do it, if you can just naturally level to 4 and go 5 at krugs, do that. Use your best judgement, how strong are you? How likely is it that you can winstreak? Scout a lot early to see how strong you are compared to everyone else and base your decisions off that information. Make sure you keep economy in mind, you   to be at around 50g at 3-2.  Go 6 at 3-2. Do not roll. You're probably looking for Vi/Rumble here. Any gold you have above 50 should be put into XP from now until you hit level 8.  Mid game you   to just hard-eco, only buy cybernetics and mech pilots, you   to hit 6 cybernetics ASAP so you should look to be level 7 with 50g just after the carousel in 3-5. Space pirates should help you out here. If you're super weak, roll a little, but you should really be hard on the eco here. If you find Ekko at level 7, switch to 6 cybernetic immediately, sell Jayce and transfer all of his AP/Mana items to Ekko. If you have any other items on him, spread them between your other cybernetic champs. You only need one on each.  If you've got more than 6 items, stack Ekko first, then Irelia.  You   to hit 8 around 4-1 - 4-3. Gauge how much HP you have left and how much you can afford to lose, try to wait as long as possible before levelling to 8. You're going to roll down here and try to stabilise. If you do not have 6 cybernetic yet, this is where you're going to need to get them. As soon as you hit 6 cybernetic, make sure each of them is on the board and that each of them has at least one item on. The 850HP and 85AD on each of them collectively is a huge buff to your team and you will spike super hard once you hit 6.  Do not continue rolling after you have 6 cybernetics each with an item on them. Prefer Fizz over Annie/Rumble, as the infiltrator trait activates with Ekko. You need to eco really hard again to hit 9 and put your last mech pilot on the board, this will secure you first/second place. You should be winning most fights now, if not, you've done something wrong, Ekko stacked with AP/Mana is the most important thing here, Irelia with decent items is also important. If you have items on your mech pilots you fucked up, you need to have one full item on each cybernetic and three items on Ekko and Irelia ideally. You should be able to hit 9 around 5-1 provided you didn't roll too hard at 8. If you can wait a little longer to go 9 so you have some gold to roll with after levelling you've got an even higher chance of grabbing Ekko2.  In summary, you're making super high value plays while econning really hard and then really setting the tempo late game by going early 8 and rolling. You force others to roll or level when they don't   to just to keep up with you which fucks their econ game plan because the late game damage is huge. You're going to be chunking people for at least 15hp with every match when you're winning.", "id": "fi22ph", "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": 1584115916},

{"title": "Micro vs Macro Skill - Identifying and Improving Mistakes", "author": "JohnnyBlack22", "selftext": "Hey guys!  JohnnyBlack here to hit you with one last guide before set 3 drops (maybe I'll do one more).  This sub has basically just been a set 3 waiting room for the last week, but I know there are still plenty of competitive players out there like me who find the unbalanced, work-in-progress-UX PBE experience quite boring and prefer the competitive ringer of good ol' set 2.  That said, let's discuss the two different types of skill that exist in this game and how to improve across each of them.  I call them  Micro  and  Macro  skill, but you could also think of them as  strategy  and  tactics .  # Overview  ## Micro Skill  * What is it? * How do you identify mistakes? * How do you improve?  ## Macro Skill  * What is it? * How do you identify mistakes? * How do you improve?  ## Final thoughts  * Conclusion * Set 3 changes  # Micro Skill  Micro skill, or tactics, is all the little things you do each turn to preserve hp, or to win fights you otherwise would have lost.  Additionally, it's how good you are at the physical act of rolling, at positioning your zephyr's, at doing things like mana bugging, ect.  ## Identifying Micro Mistakes  These mistakes are typically pretty clear.  Here are some indications your micro skill needs work:  * Your  s keep getting Zephyred.  If this is happening, you need to focus more on scouting around for zephyrs and avoiding them. * Your zephrys never hit anything good   same point here * You intend to roll to 0 but always end up with 30 gold.  You're rolling too slow   this probably means you're not buffering enough  if I hit this, then I'll do this  style thinking into previous turns * You miss viable pivots in the shop due to lack of prethinking.  Ex: You don't realize you have a bad warden in the game, and forget to take Malphytes or Natiluses  to replace him on your rolldown (I did this today) * You often have head-scratcher losses where you felt like you were strong.  This likely means that you're positioning is bad somehow * You don't know what's going on in the fights   you have to watch them so you can adjust your positioning * You mess up your Karma tether * You have rounds where too many items, especially combined items, are on your bench  (probably after a rolldown and transition)  When you mess up Micro skill, you usually know you've messed it up.  You see your   get Zephyred or you see your Karma tethering Janna.  What you might not realize is just how much this is effecting your placements.  In many games at Plat/Diamond and almost every single game in Master+, a 5hp difference is at least one placement, and often more than one.  Winning a fight you would have lost?  Could be 3 placements.  It's not unreasonable, and, in fact, probably happens to me about 1/10 games, to go from a bottom 3 to a top 2 just by better micro skill allowing you to live an extra turn and spike.  ## How to improve  Force a comp.  Or two.  Pick two comps that use complimentary items and only force those two comps.  Basically, you have to abandon Macro skill (which we'll get to next) and only focus on the short term tactical decisions.  That's the only way to learn them.  If your mind is constantly working overtime on what  s to flex in next, where you're going on lvl 8, what your final comp should look like, which items should I slam, am I playing for Zed this game, etc, then you'll never have the mental resources to actually improve your micro skill.  You'll never get to the point where you're getting the absolute most out of your board every turn, and you'll think you're losing because you're playing the wrong comp, or because you didn't spike, or whatever other reason when really you're just tossing away 10hp per game to bad micro decisions, and if you had that 10 hp your placements would be fine.  I'm sure you've all experienced this before.  If you have a super complex game where you're constantly flexing in and out  s, swapping items around, rolling, and pivoting, you're getting zephyred left and right and your positioning is always trash.  Our mind only has a fix amount of resources at its disposal while we're playing, so we have to use them efficiently.  If Micro skill is a problem for you, you need to play games without Macro skill for a bit in order to get all the Micro skills to a level where you no longer really need to think about them.  This is why one trick players do so well   they're able to completely optimize their comp at a Micro level, each turn getting the absolute most out of their board with the best positioning, because they mastered the Macro strategy for it long ago and thus can spend all their mental resources on Micro.  # Macro Skill  Macro skill, or strategy, is your long term plan and decisions for the game.  The  peeba  comp is a great example we can use to explain good and bad Micro skill, or strategy.  Early in 10.5b, when people didn't realize that Ezriel was the best midgame  , and when the remnants of shadows were still dominant enough that Zed wasn't as contested, the  peeba  comp (glacial electric   wardens   lunar   zed 3 electric) was a viable strategy.  It was so viable, in fact, that it could even be forced to great effect.  Now that most of those variables have changed, it's no longer nearly as powerful of a strategy and can't be forced anymore.  Therefore, if you were to exclusively run the  peeba  comp, even if your Micro skill level remained *completely unchanged*, a change in the meta could be the difference between top 3ing every game and bottom 3ing every game.  What changed was the validity of your strategy, your Macro skill.  This is all hypothetical of course.  ## Identifying Macro Mistakes  Mistakes in Macro skill are far harder to identify than ones in Micro skill.  Whereas when you get Zephyred, it's very obvious what went wrong, when you transitioned to a bad comp on lvl 8 given your items, or slammed an incorrect item on stage 2 that's causing you to lose now, that's very difficult to observe.  The best way to determine weak point in your Macro skill is to check your opponent's gold and level (and maybe hp) after each fight, and evaluate how you're doing in the game vs him.  This will tell you whether you're doing well, doing average, or way behind the rest of the lobby.  Then, you observe changes in this to tell you where you're messing up.  For example   Early in this patch I had a problem where I couldn't for the life of me transition from strong lvl 6 boards to strong lvl 7-8 boards.  How did I identify that problem?  Because I'd be at lvl 6 60g, and I'd beat people who were lvl 6 20g, or who were lvl 7 10g.  These players had already leveled and rolled, and here I was with 60g winning close fights against them.  Surely, then, after I roll, I'll dominate them, right?  Further, I'd crush other people lvl 6 50g, meaning that if we both spiked the same, I should crush them after we rolled as well.  Overall, I could deduce that, on lvl 6, I was insanely strong and super far ahead of these other players.  But then by the time I was, say, lvl 7 30g, the fights were a lot closer.  And once I got to lvl 8 0g, all of the sudden I was losing, and sometimes losing hard, to these same players that I was just dominating in board and econ one stage ago.  Using that information, I knew that my weakness was lvl6- lvl8.  ## How to improve  Once I'd identified the lvl 6-lvl 8 transition as my weakness, I watched streams of top level players with two main questions in mind:  1. What  s do these players use when they transition into lvl 7 and 8 comps? 2. Which items are most responsible for the strength of these lvl 7-8 comps they're using?  After that, I did some off table work to figure out how to adapt what I learned into my transitions.  For me personally, I  ted playing Annie/Yorik/Azir and Malphyte much more and  ted forcing shadows harder if I'd already slammed a lockett (among a bunch of other things).  I fixed that problem, and now I convert those dominant level 6 boards into wins, instead of awkwardly getting 4th or 5th after highrolling the early game.  To summarize, improving Micro skill is a two part process:  1. Use other people's level and gold to figure out when you're falling off 2. Once you figure out what your weakness is, watch streams in the context of that weakness, and determine what they're doing that you're not.  Your weakness might be different than mine.  Maybe you're bad in the early game   you find that by turn 5 you're already getting crushed by people with more gold than you.  Or maybe it's the late game   you're winning on lvl 8 but somehow can never actually top 1.  Whatever it is, identify it, then focus on what top players are doing *in that area* while you watch, and you'll fix the weakness.  # Final Thoughts  Improving either your Micro or Macro skill will make you a much better player.  Specifically Micro skill, I think, is very overlooked until GM+ elo, and you'll be amazed how much better your placements are if you force one or two comps and just focus on positioning and mechanics every turn.  Still though, make sure you're playing strong stuff.  You don't   to highroll and get 3rd; if that's happening to you it means the comps you're playing just suck.  Watch some top players and figure out what general combinations and paths through the game you should be aiming at, and you'll gain LP in no time :)  **Set 3**  Hopefully, this content pretty much applies to Set 3 as much as it does to set 2.  So that's good.  That said, I think I'll be taking a break from the game when Set 3 drops.  With the econ and hp changes... I just think the game I love will be gone.  Currently, you have lots of gold, which gives you numerous viable paths on every turn throughout the early game.  Literally *on turn 1-2* are your first meaningful, game defining decisions.  Every turn of stage 1 and stage 2 is a game defining moment, and you can make numerous game winning moves or game losing mistakes in those turns.  The game  ts as a sprint, and that sprint never ends until you've won or you're dead.  I LOVE that.  I love it so much.  Every turn matters.  Every point of HP matters.  Every   you killed or didn't kill, every round you forgot to slam your uncombined belt and it cost you 2hp   It all matters and being an elite player means optimizing, non stop, every single turn.  Contrast that to Set 3 which is basically just pick your  s, hope to 2 * them naturally, and lvl 8 waiting room.  The early damage doesn't even matter, and all enemy  s just cost 1HP anyway, meaning that how much you win or lose by is dwarfed by whether or not you win or lose   and only on Stage 4-5.  I believe it's going to feel like a fundamentally different game, one that I really have no desire to play, despite how much I love the game in its current state.  And this is not even addressing how they arbitrarily remove decisions by having some carousels be uniform, or the set 3 color scheme being too monochromatic and annoying to learn.  Anyway, I've really enjoyed making guides for you guys, and if they revert some of these changes, or if it turns out the best players are all still 16 LP and the game is actually still competitive and fun  t to finish, maybe I'll come back.  I might post one more guide if I get Challenger this season; I've been around 3 LP for a while but it's hard to play knowing it's all going away in 10 days :(  Anyway, I hope this guide was useful and you all gain many divisions by following it.

{"title": "Everything You Need to Know About Your Odds While Rolling (and the math behind it)", "author": "JohnnyBlack22", "selftext": "Hey guys,  Friendly reddit statistics professor Dr. J Black here to teach you everything you need to know about the math behind rolling for  s.  If you just   to see the formulas for what I believe to be the most useful numbers to calculate   finding at least 1 or at least 2  s when rolling a certain amount of gold on a certain level, then skip to that section.  I recommend clicking the ** Pretty version ** link as it'll be far easier to read.  Let's go!  ## Overview * What my variables mean * Translating gold to number of chances * Probability of getting a specific   in a shop slot * Probability of getting at least 1 of a   * Probability of getting at least 2 of a   * Some examples * Some useful level thresholds to know * Final thoughts  ## What my variables mean  You'll see these variables in the equations below.  This section is so that there's (hopefully) no confusion in what value I'm referencing with each.  * **g** = amount of gold you're going to roll * **pCost** = chance of getting a   of that cost, at your level (for example, pCost of a 4-cost at level 7 = .15) * **num s** = number of unique  s at that cost (e.g. there are 10 4-cost  s)  ##  Translating gold to number of chances  This is pretty simple.  We know it costs 2g to roll, and each shop gives you 5  s.  The first step is easy   just divide your amount of gold by 2, and that's how many rolls you get.    Next, we multiply that number by 5, because we have 5 chances at our   in each shop.    We can do this because each separate   in the shop is independent of the other 4.  There are no restrictions like, for example,  you can't see 5 of one   in your shop  or  there will be at least 3 different cost values in your shop .  Because none of said restrictions exist, each   in the shop is an independent sample, so we can correctly say that rolling x times gives us 5x independent individual   draws.  **Number of chances at a  ** = (5/2)g  ## Probability of getting a specific   in a shop slot  Next, we need to know the chance of getting, say, a Lucian in a slop shot that we're rolling for.  This is also pretty straightforward.  First, we roll for the cost of the  , and next, we roll for the   itself.    The chance of getting the cost of the   is determined by your level (for example: lvl 7 and 4 cost is .15), and the chance of getting the   itself is 1/(how many of those  s exist).  For Lucian on lvl 7, for example, we're looking at (.15)(1/10).  **Chance of getting a specific  ** = (pCost)/(num s)  ## Probability of getting at least 1 of a    The easiest way to calculate this is with a compliment.  There are only two possibilities:  1. We get 0 of a   2. We get at least 1 of a    We're going to calculate the probability of getting 0 of a  , and then subtract that from 1.  So what's the probability that we miss our   in every single slop shot?  Well, it's our chance of missing, raised to the power of how many slop shots we have.  **Chance of missing** = (1   chance of hitting) = (1   (pCost)/(num s))  **Shop slots** = (5/2)g  **Therefore, the chance of getting at least one   is:**  (1   (1   (pCost)/(num s)) ^((5/2)g))  [Pretty version]   ## Probability of getting at least 2 of a    What's the chance of getting at least 2 of a  ?  Well, that's pretty similar to the chance to get at least 1 of a  .  The only difference is, getting exactly 1 of that   is now a failure case, instead of a success case.  Therefore, we can reuse a lot of work we've already done.   We need to calculate: 1   (chance of getting 0 of the  )   (chance of getting exactly 1 of the  )  We know the first two terms already; that's the answer to our previous section.  The tough part is the  chance of getting exactly 1 of the   part .  Here's how we do it: First, we   to pick a single shop slot that exists in our rolldown, and calculate the chance that our   shows up in that shop slot, and only that shop slot  Next, we   to multiply by the total number of shop slots, because our   showing up in any of the specific shop slots is a success case.  (Note   This is more complicated when we're looking for a number of  s greater than 1.  For example, if we're looking for exactly 3 of a   when rolling 20 times (1  shop slots), then we need to find the number of ways we can choose 3 slop slots out of 1 .  It's a mathematical expression called a  combination , which you can google if you're curious.  We'd   the  combination of 1  choose 3 , expressed C(1 , 3).  In our case, we're lucky: We   the combination of  how many ways can we choose 1 thing from 1  , which is just 1 ).  **Chance our   is in our slop shot** = (pCost)(num s)  **Chance our   is NOT in any other slop shot** = (1   (pCost/num s)) ^{((5/2)g   1)}  **Number of different ways we can choose our 1 slop shot** = C((5/2)g, 1) = (5/2)g  **Chance of getting exactly 1 of a  ** = (5/2)g(pCost)(num s)(1   (pCost/num s)) ^((5/2)g   1)  **And so our final equation for getting at least 2 of a   is**:  1   (1   (pCost)/(num s)) ^((5/2)g)   (5/2)g(pCost)(num s)(1   (pCost/num s)) ^((5/2)g   1)  [Pretty version]    Note   Those two numbers on top of each other are shorthand for a combination, specifically C((5/2)g, 1), which just equals (5/2)g.  ## Some Examples  For each of the following examples, you can paste the equation as seen here into [Wolphram Alpha]  and modify the variables as you like.  **The Chance of finding at least 1 Olaf at Level 7 on**    **50g**:  1 - (1   ((1/8)(.15))) ^(125) = .85  **30g**:  1 - (1   ((1/8)(.15))) ^(75) = .68  **10g**:  1 - (1   ((1/8)(.15))) ^(25) = .31  **The Chance of finding at least 2 Olafs at Level 7 on**    **50g**:  1 - (1 - ((1/10)(.15))) ^(125)   (125)*((1/10)(.15))*(1-(1/10)(.15)) ^124 = .56  **30g**:  1 - (1 - ((1/10)(.15))) ^(125)   (125)*((1/10)(.15))*(1-(1/10)(.15)) ^124 = .31  **10g**:  1 - (1 - ((1/10)(.15))) ^(125)   (125)*((1/10)(.15))*(1-(1/10)(.15)) ^124 = .05  ## Some useful level thresholds to know  So should you roll, or level then roll?  For the most part, the answer is definitely level than roll, but let's dive into some numbers anyway.  Let's say you're on level 7 at 5-1.  You're considering leveling to 8, which would cost 36 gold.  You then   to find 2 copies of a 4 cost  .  What is the point at which you'd have the same chance to find the  s if you rolled first, vs leveled, then rolled?  * **g** = gold before leveling * **P(x, pCost, num s)** = probability of getting at least 2  s with x gold, a certain pCost, and a certain num s.  When we level, g and pCost change, but num s does not.  To find the break even point, we  :  **(Chance of getting it rolling on level 7) = (Chance of getting it leveling to 8, then rolling)**  In our variable terms: P(g, .15, 10) = P(g-36, .24, 10)  Again, I'll give you the formula, and you can plug it into Wolphram Alpha and mess around as you like. The closer this value is to 0, the more even your chance of getting your  s.  The first term is the chance to get your  s on the current level, and the next term is the chance to get them if you level first. Therefore, we can infer based on the sign of the result: * Positive =  better to not level.   * Negative =  better to level first.  **I   at least 2 of a 4 cost.  It will cost 36g to level from 7-8**  1 - (1 - ((1/10)(.15))) ^185   (185)((1/10)(.15))(1-(1/10)(.15)) ^184 - (1 - (1 - ((1/10)(.24))) ^95   (95)((1/10)(.24))(1-(1/10)(.24)) ^94)  So the break even point here is  ting with roughly 74g (185 shop slots on lvl 7).  If you have 74g and you   at least 2 copies of a 4 cost, whether you level first or roll it all on 7, you have roughly the same chance to get it.  Another interesting case is 5 cost  s and whether or not to level to 9 first.  I'm going to use the case where it takes 54 gold to level (6-2).  **I   at least 2 copies of a 5 cost.  It will cost 56g to level from 8-9**  1 - (1 - ((1/6)(.06))) ^210   (210)((1/6)(.06))(1-(1/6)(.06)) ^209 - (1 - (1 - ((1/6)(.15))) ^70   (70)((1/6)(.15))(1-(1/6)(.15)) ^69)  The break even point here is roughly 84g.  With 84g, you'll have the same chance of getting 2 copies of a 5 cost   whether you roll at 8, or level then roll.  ## Final thoughts  As you can see, it actually doesn't take *that* much gold over what you need to level for the chance to even out.  There are actually a lot of games where you can find yourself close to the break even point.   The upshot from this math is that, because the odds of getting an important   goes up so much when you level, it's almost always correct to level, reduce the odds of finding it a little (but not that much), and then get the benefit of the extra  .  If you read this whole thing, you must really like math, like I do.  Cheers :)  **tl;dr**   You should pretty much always level first, with the exception of level 8.  You definitely have lower odds of finding your  s (unless you have an obscene amount of gold), but the difference isn't as great as you'd think, because the chance of finding that   on each roll goes up.  **P.S.** - I'm happy to re-explain or condense certain things at request in the comments.  Also if anyone thinks I made a mistake in my math, let me know!", "id": "fc17a9", "num_comments": 44, "created_utc": 1583098984},

{"title": "Hit Challenger - Some Random Tips for Climbing", "author": "esportslaw", "selftext": "Hey All!  I just hit Challenger   which has been my personal goal for a while, and this sub has helped me a ton in trying to improve so I'm making this post to try to give back a tiny bit. I'm not going to do a guide to comps/econ because there is already so much good content on that front. These are just some random tips that I think can help anyone improve at the game. Hope you find them helpful   happy to answer questions in the comments.  **Learn Every Tree**: This game is a series of decision making, and if you only feel comfortable forcing a narrow subset of meta comps then you are capping your potential. Sometimes the game is giving you genuinely bad  s/items/gold, but in many instances it's something that is actually decent (or even strong) but you simply can't recognize it as such. You don't have to be an expert in every single meta comp, but you should at the very least be comfortable recognizing and going a comp if the game slaps you in the face with it. Having a second screen with a comp sheet can be super helpful while you're learning. I make my own for every patch, but you can easily just pull from one of the various resources others are creating regularly.  **Commit As Soon As Possible**: Enter the game with all of the options at your disposal, but your earliest important task is to narrow those options based on what the game is giving you. Your initial item drops should narrow the pool of options considerably, and the longer the game goes the more information you have to make the crucial decision to lock in on a single comp. The sooner you commit, the sooner you'll become efficient in terms of deciding what  s to keep and what  s to sell.   The trick is to find the sweet spot of when the game has given you enough info to make a particular commitment. That will vary wildly from game to game, and it only comes with experience and critical thinking. If you're hard committing to preds because you got a kog/wick in your first shop with a single rod, you're over eager and exposing yourself to much more bad RNG potential. But if you get 5 kogs, skarner, and wick with tear-rod-vest-vest in PVE then you better type  me preds  in chat and be as greedy as possible in selling  s. This is more art than science. It's a complex analysis of the  s/gold/items you have so far and the level of confidence you can have in forcing a single direction from that moment onward. To help visualize this, here is my rough, CURRENT breakdown of when I commit to a comp:  * Sometime super early: 20% * Right after Krugs: 30% * Right at 3-2: 40% * Anytime after that: 10%  I say current because this varies a lot based on meta. Things are on the more agro side right now and the 3-2 roll down is pivotal, but in the fast 8 meta I was often staying open much later into the game. No matter the meta, everyone will differ in their allocations here based on how greedy they play and their capability of evaluating an increasingly complex set of options as the game goes on   better players can stay open longer (for example, Grandvice sometimes pivots super late in game in ways that are insanely impressive), but don't feel like you have to be able to do that to be successful. The important thing is to be looking for your comp commitment in the best way possible for your personal capabilities (e.g. finding the equilibrium between being a one trick and being so open that you have bad econ and frequently get into games where you die not knowing what you're doing).   [A quick side note about one tricking: it can be super effective in this game because it's amazing how much efficiency you gain by evaluating every decision for a single lens. I also think it's a great way to improve when you're  ting out because it allows you to focus on all of the other components of the game (econ, level timings, roll downs, etc.). With that said, I don't think it's optimizing for climbing in the long run. Of course, you CAN climb by one tricking. But you're likely increasing the volume of games required to climb because there will be some games that could easily be top 4s if you were open to other comps, but don't work because you  ted with too narrow of an option tree. ]  **Think Before You Play**: Obvious, I know, but bear with me. How often do you going into a game knowing what specific skills you're trying to improve (learning new comps, positioning, faster/cleaner roll downs, etc)? When you finish a game, do you stop to ask yourself what you could've done better? Do you look at your profile to see what comps tend to be successful for you, what don't, and evaluate why that might be? There are no mechanics in tft, so you're not going to improve through repetition in the same way you might in a game where you can go from shitty aim to decent aim just by playing. Stop and think to make sure you're actually learning from your mistakes and continuing an upward trajectory of skill.  **Know What You're Playing For**: After every big roll down, you should scout the lobby and determine how likely you are to finish in what position based on your board strength, economy, and life total. This is crucial to deciding how greedy/aggressive you need to be in your decision making. It often times takes more skill to turn an 8th into a 6th than a 3rd into a 1st because the first step is to realize you're supposed to be in playing for 6th mode. Become an expert at that, and you'll minimize your LP losses. Getting good at this will make your climb so much easier.  **Scout Twice Per Stage**: This sounds like a lot, but it's absolutely not. You will have maximum 2 rounds per stage in which your comp will meaningfully change and require your real attention. Most rounds you have a quick shop and then little to do. You should be scouting basically every such round. If you don't, what else are you doing with that time? You better have a concrete answer to that question (most commonly that you need to think about your future comp in an active way), because knowing what comp everyone in the lobby is going at all times pays serious dividends. I basically never go the same comp as more than one person and often wind up forcing something strong purely because it's completely uncontested. Check my profile and you'll see a bunch of recent mage wins. It's part item RNG for sure, and part because it's really easy to hit your  s and maintain econ with everyone in the lobby thinning out the pool for you.  **Zephyr**:   I wrote this late last night and hadn't seen this recent post of zephyr tips, which is really good:   Many of mine overlap, but I think there's some good supplementation of those points so I'll leave them in.  * Make them. This item is by far the best use of either cloaks or belts. It's good in literally every comp, early, mid, and late game. There are some situations where you can use your items more optimally, but if you're making zephyr it's almost never bad. * Use them actively. You need to scout the lobby and think about your comp before deciding if you're better frontlining or backlining your zephyr. Make sure you're looking for a last second zephyr placement when you're down to only a few players. Look to sell and replace  s to get more late game zephyr cheese opport ies. If you're setting and essentially forgetting your zephyr, you're leaving so much LP on the table. * Note them while scouting. When you scout, you have two main jobs - tracking what comps people are playing, and spotting zephyrs. There are tons of complex positioning techniques, but if we're being honest they're niche and not very helpful for the vast majority of players. Noting common zephyr positions and avoiding them is something anyone can do quickly, but few take the time. * Hide your  s. If you have a zephyr, place it on your bench until the last second. People won't notice you have it, and even once they realize you'll be way less predictable in your placement. If you're facing zephyrs, place your carry on the bench to make it harder for them to track its final placement.  OK, this is way more long-winded than I intended. If you actually made it to the end here, I hope you found it helpful.", "id": "fbfvbo", "num_comments": 36, "created_utc": 1582997442},

{"title": "Me Bird - A Guide to forcing Azir", "author": "reportbrasilforfeed", "selftext": "   **Me Bird- A Guide to forcing Azir**      Hi, im mental Set 1 Dia 1/GM player, Set 2 Challenger  (    Last patch and this patch post-hotfix I've mainly been forcing Azir to gain LP.  First carousel priority is **Bow   Rod   Vest   Glove   Tear   Belt   Cloak**. You   to prioritize getting a **Rageblade** first. Other than that, a **Bramble Vest** for a better early/mid game or **HoJ**, are fine early games.      **Early Game**       I usually prefer the Glacial Electric opener, using Ezreal or Volibear as an Azir item holder. Try to pick up any Leona, Braum, Azir, Karma along the way. Other than that you can buy Renekton's, Qiyana and Yasuo as long as they dont cost you a lot of econ.   The early game for this comp works out similar to any other comp, try to win streak if you can, leveling aggressively to maintain a win streak, otherwise semi-open fort and keep a perfect Losestreak      **Mid Game**      3-2: You all-in, rolling down for Karma, Azir, Leona, Janna, Yasuo, Braum/Malphite. Ideally you should have a Rageblade HoJ at this point and hit Azir 2. On 6 roll down aggressively to 10 or 20 until you hit Azir 2, Karma 2, Braum 2, then from 3-5/3-6 econ to level to 7.  You   **Mystic/Lunar** and a good frontline in at lvl 6, otherwise you can always play Desert.         4-1: You always lvl to 7 in this Round. On Cloud or Mountain Map you   to add a Qiyana here for 3 Cloud/Mountain, otherwise more frontline or Desert is always good.   You keep rolling on 7 until you hit a good frontline(double upgraded frontline  s), Azir 2, Karma 2. Then once you feel you're strong enough to econ, which will usually be after carousel econ to 8.  If you hit your upgrades early, you can go for a fast 8.               **Late Game**      If you hit all your upgrades, you can finally go 8. At 8 there are several variations I like to play. If your lobby is very AD-focused (Zerkers, Ranger) you ideally   to find Cloud Lux for 4 Cloud. If you cannot find Cloud Lux I like to play 4 Warden for a lot of Frontline.        In an AP-focused lobby (Ocean mages, Other Azir players) you   to play 4 Mystic. Ideally you find Yi and use him as a secondary Carry to Azir. Your Mystics should be Karma, Janna, Yi, Soraka or an upgraded Nami.     At 9 you can add a Cloud Lux, 4 Mystic or 4 Warden to any of those comps        As usual, adapt this to your Lobby.      **Item Priority**      The most important item in this comp is **Rageblade** on Azir. This item is irreplaceable, it has everything he  s Attack Speed, AP and he scales it very quickly with Karma Shields and Lunar Procs.  After that you   a **HoJ** on Azir, after the Mana nerfs he needs this to quickly spawn a Soldier in the fight to quickly RNG-oneshot the enemy carry. HoJ is the best Item for this, since it helps his survivability against Assassins/AoE with Hea. With Damage it massively boosts his damage output by 50%, allowing him to more quickly kill enemy carries.  As a replacement for HoJ I like **Shojin**, as he will spawn a second soldier while the first soldier is still active, giving him more AoE damage. Shojin is a somewhat controversial choice on him, since he will cast more often, which will lower his auto-attack output. I'm still not certain if Shojin is that good on him, but I've grown to like it.  If you cannot get a HoJ or Shojin, or simply can make it, a **second Rageblade** will massively increase Azir's damage scaling even more.  Viable third items are **QSS** (mainly against Zerker and Ocean Mage), **Spell Crit** (scales very well with lunar and HoJ), **RFC** (just solid and really helps against Zerkers, since Azir won't walk up and get Glacial stunned).      Perfect Azir: Double Rageblade, HoJ.      Item priority outside of Azir are Bramble Vest/GA on a Frontliner. Zephyr on a Frontliner/a Qiyana  If you already have good Azir Items you can  t to stack a Yasuo as a secondary carry. Perfect items for him are GA/HoJ/BT.  Playing around Yasuo depends on the lobby. I will usually 3 Item Azir and stack a frontliner with tank item + component + Hex if I'm against only 1 Yasuo player.  Against 2+ Yasuo Players you never 3 Item your Azir, and use a frontliner as a bait, as I outlined before.  If you're ahead and can afford not to 3 Item your Azir, you can wait until the Yasuo player dies, and then look to 3 Item him later. You can only do this, if you know you're playing for 1st in the lobby.  If you get a Malphite 2, you can stack him as a secondary Carry. Give him Bramble Vest, GA and any other good Malphite items (Hextech Gunblade, Morello, Zephyr, Warmogs). With Lunar procs Malphite turns into a legitimate Carry Threat and will pretty much auto-win the Assassin matchup with Bramble Vest.  Qiyana is a good secondary carry on Cloud/Mountain Map. Give her a Zephyr and she will usually snipe the centered Carry, as she will Zephyr the Assassin bait. Shojin is exceptional if you can afford to make it, and will usually carry your mid game.  She does however fall off late game, as she dies too easily.      **Positioning**      Always tether Karma to your Azir, make sure not to 50/50 with any other  . Place Janna above your Azir to help against Assassins/any other  s getting on to him. Azir has a lot of survivability with Karma Shield and Janna Heal.  If you have a Braum, put him in the very front so that he gets focused, and soaks up a lot of damage with his ult. You can then position Leona behind him or right next to him, it really depends on your own preference.  Use Karma as a natural Assassin bait, and Yasuo as second Assassin bait. You can move up Azir up one row against Qiyanas if there are no Amumu players.      Use hexes as is appropriate in the early game. Give Azir an Inferno Hex until you have a third Item.   Mountain Hex Azir depends on the Hex positioning(Zephyr and Qiyanas), otherwise just mountain stack Karma.   Ocean Hex is a good item until you can get a Tear on Azir, after you have a tear give it to Karma.      **Matchups**      **Rangers**  - This matchup is the easiest, and you will pretty much auto-win this if Azir doesn't Soldier an invulnerable target from Taric Ult. Play 4 Cloud/4 Warden against this.  **Zerkers**  - This matchup is hard, use the anti-zerker positioning posted in the subreddit(  you should prioritize a QSS on Azir if the Lobby is running a lot of Zerkers/Ocean Mages. Play 4 Cloud/4 Warden against this.  **Ocean Mage**  - This matchup is hard if they have 6 Mage Malphite, otherwise it's manageable. Be careful, not to corner your Azir, as he will not get stunned by Nautilus, corner Karma instead. Play 4 Mystic against this.  **Yasuo**  - Stack a frontliner bait and in a perfect world, don't 3 Item your Azir. This should be an easy matchup in that case. If they are more Azir focused play 4 Mystic, if their Azir isn't a threat play 4 Cloud/4 Warden against this.  **Shadows**  - This matchup was very hard pre-hotfix, now it depends on Azir RNG. Be careful and back row your Azir, so he doesn't get stunned by Sion stun. Position around your Azir opposite Yi, so he doesn't get onto him very fast, play around Assassin Yi as appropriate. Play 4 Cloud/4 Warden against this.      **Questions**      Why not go Sum/Sins?   The summoner buff does not give a lot of benefit to Azir and the Assassin buff is only worth if you have good Kha'Zix items or Zed items. You can pivot from this comp into Sum/Sins if you hit a Kha'Zix 2 and Yorick 2 or don't have great Azir items. Otherwise I think this comp is superior if you   to play Azir carry.  Should I play this comp every game?   I think this comp is forcable, and is especially great on Inferno/Cloud Map. Otherwise I recommend playing this if you roll Azir on a 3-2 roll down and already have a Rageblade.  Why do you usually drop Desert?   Azir does mainly AP damage, so Desert gives him little benefit. You can play Desert with Yasuo as a secondary carry, if you get the items. Otherwise it's also OK to play with a Kha'Zix 2 as a secondary carry      Thanks for reading my guide and feel free to ask any questions you  !", "id": "fagetn", "num_comments": 46, "created_utc": 1582827914},

This'll be helpful when you're Top4 and can be confident that you'll face a zerker player next.  You wanna move your carry to one corner and then move your entire frontline to the opposite side of the map:    This causes the zerkers to jump to your frontline's side of the map. After they kill your frontline they'll move to your backline non-carry  s, leaving your carry free to deal damage for the entire fight:    Here's an example of this in action:   I knew my next fight would be vs Gunmay or the other zerker player, so I picked one of them and positioned against him. Not a perfect clip but it shows how this creates two columns of space for your carry.   _ _ _  Keep in mind this is less reliable if Olaf has sin spat. It's also less reliable if your carry isn't Ashe (crystal) because you have to be careful about Khazix too, but if Khazix has a tear item then you likely don't have to worry -- he'll hit your carry twice and then ult to your frontline.", "id": "fa3bev", "num_comments": 18, "created_utc": 1582763063},

{"title": "How to Talk to Yourself While You Play (and why you should)", "author": "JohnnyBlack22", "selftext": "If there's one piece of advice I could give any player to climb divisions, it would be this   work on your internal monologue while you play.  And actually, make it external.  It works better. Talk to yourself constantly while you play.  GM JohnnyBlack here again, with something you could maybe call a midgame guide.  In my opinion, the following content is most applicable to lvl 5, lvl 6, and lvl 7.  If you can master this self talk in that section of the game, you'll make far fewer mistakes and navigate it much more cleanly.  The reason it's so hard to make midgame content is that it's different every game, so I can't just tell you what  s to play or when to level/roll.  Given that, here's some instruction which is hopefully of the  teach a man to fish  variety.  With respect to [the chart]  the following questions should help you improve primarily along the Econ and  s dimensions (With the questions I decided to list; self talk will help across literally all of them).  ## Overview  1. Why talk to yourself? 2. Talking before leveling 3. Talking before rolling 4. Talking before pivoting 5. Conclusion/Lolchess  In each section, I've bolded what I believe to be the most important question to ask yourself.  ## Why talk to yourself  If possible, you should talk out loud to yourself every turn.  The main reason for talking out loud is that it forces you to actually do it.  If you allow yourself to  just think  instead, if you get a little tilted, or a little tired, or a little distracted, you might stop  just thinking  without realizing it.  All of the sudden you zone back in and you've turned a 1st into a 4th, or a 5th into an 8th.  By committing to talking out loud, you'll notice,  Wait, I didn't say anything this turn.  Did I actually think?   I'm not exaggerating when I say that, for me personally, talking to myself every turn is roughly a 3 division difference.  I'm a GM player normally, and if I don't talk every turn (read: forget to think every turn), I'm a D2ish player.  So talk, talk talk.  ## Talking before leveling  Any time you're about to level.  * **What's the best thing to play if I level?** * How much stronger does that get me? * How much interest does it cost me to level? * How greedy can I afford to be here based on hp/board strength? * Am I rolling when I level (see next section)?  Ask these questions out loud, and come up with the best answers you can.  I see so many people literally auto pilot the times that they level.  Even worse, not only do the level on a strict schedule, but they roll at the same times every game too.  Stop doing that.  Chat with yourself about these 5 questions not just on the turn you plan to level, but also on the previous turns.  Any time you have down time in the game, use it to work on your near term (or long term) plan.  This game is too complex to make all the decisions in the moment.Now, often when you level, you're rolling...  ## Talking before rolling  Many people roll on auto pilot.  Even more than leveling on auto-pilot, rolling for no reason is a great way to donate LP.  * **What can I hit to get stronger?** * How many pairs do I have? * If I don't roll, how much hp will I lose? * Does the cost of the  s I'm looking for match the %s of the level I'm on? * Would I roll to 0 if I hit nothing? * Is rolling better than using this gold to level?  Here's one of the huge befits of talking through all these questions with yourself *before* rolling: you know when to stop.  Let's say you're trying to hit Malphyte to get stronger, and you have 2 pairs.  And in your second shop you hit Malphyte and one of the pairs.  That's it, you're done.  And you know that, because you already thought about what you're spikes were and how much stronger you had to get to maintain sufficient HP.  On the flip side, let's say you haven't hit and you've rolled 30g, with 20g left.  Do you keep going?  Again, you don't have time to make that decision in the moment.  *Before* you rolled, you decided if you didn't hit you're going 8th, so in the moment you know to just keep mashing D.  Godspeed friend.  ## While pivoting (and many turns before, please)  Most of these questions you should just ask any time there's downtime in the game.  Pivoting from a strong midgame comp into a lategame one is tough.  It's an extremely precise science, and if you mess it up too badly you can literally lose 20hp in one turn.  I think we've all been there.  * What do I   my final comp to look like? * **How do I get there without getting weaker** * What order am I getting rid of these  s * Are any of these midgame  s actually just staying the whole game? * Are we playing for 1st here or top 4? * Is 9 reasonable this game? * Do I have a realistic spike at 9 or am I rolling on 8? * Who's getting what items from my current midgame  s?  This is probably the hardest part of the game.  The key to it is pre-thinking as much as you possibly can.  When I successfully pivot my trees or glacial stuff into a 1st place late game comp, it's literally just execution on the actual turns where  s switch.  I hardly ever roll into a  , see it, think, then swap it.  I go,  Oh, there's an Annie2.  I already decided if I hit Annie it's going here, and we're selling that, and those items which popped off are going here.   If you don't do this, you'll sac free HP on the turns where you switch stuff.  ## Final Thoughts  Some of you might be a little skeptical -  JohnnyBlack, you've only given me the questions!  What about the answers!   Just give it a shot.  As any good engineer will tell you, finding the answer to your question is usually pretty straightforward; the hard part is asking the right question.  So talk to yourself.  Force yourself to think.  Use these questions, and you'll gain at least 2 divisions, guaranteed.

{"title": "Early Game Guide + Shadows Tips   Tricks", "author": "klwu", "selftext": "Hey everyone, my name's kentwuhoo and I've been a GM player since Set 1.

Also, shadows has been my favorite comp since forever so I'm sharing some lesser known tips since the comp is so strong right now.

Look for those  s after you find Yi     -Zephyr is a top tier item for this comp because you just   to buy time for your  s to refresh their buff over and over         -ZEPHYR THE FRONTLINE so your  s have free access to one-shot the backline. The worst is when your crit Kindred is hitting a bramblevest Braum for the entire fight rather than one-shotting the rest of the team     -Yi typically  s 1 offensive item and 2 defensive items         -With 6 shadows he'll be one-shotting everything after he ults anyways.

A part of that is about Berserkers because I think it's the easiest comp to climb with right now (and great for people who   to improve their econ management, gauging board power, and other macro level gameplay):      Easiest comp to climb with: Berserkers      -Zerkers are in a decent spot right now with a strong Electric early game and recently-buffed Glacial+Olaf      -They're also not ultra contested (like shadows) you can consistently Top4      -The main reason this comp is easy to climb with is that it's so linear. You don't have to think about pivots, techs, positioning, teamcomp, etc. You just buy berserkers and slam them in          - This is also a good way to learn basic econ strategies. It's kind of like playing Garen or Annie in League -- they're not mechanically demanding so you can focus on learning the macro game  I'm planning to add more sections to this guide in the future, so feel free to leave any comments or suggestions about what you'd   to see.

{"title": "[GUIDE] Advanced TFT tips and tricks - MismatchedSocks", "author": "MismatchedSock", "selftext": "Hi, this is MismatchedSocks. I'm currently ranked 1   2 on NA ladder.           I've been lurking in this comm y for a while and it's helped me out a lot. I thought it's finally time I give back to the TFT competitive comm y.   This guide is a directed towards those who have the fundamentals mastered, but   to improve their gameplay even further. It's meant as a  ting point to challenge yourself to think of even more advanced tips. I will refrain from adding my own opinions about the game and focus on facts over opinions. In this post, I chose a few tips and tricks that aren't that public knowledge, but I use pretty frequently.      1. Early game positioning vs Nasus, Renekton, Orn, and Volibear.    1. If you had Maokai and Ivern as your frontline  s, you can manipulate your positioning to minimize the impact of enemy 1-tile AOE  s.       1.         2. By putting Maokai directly in front of Nasus, and Ivern 2 spaces away from Maokai. Maokai and Ivern can tank damage, but Nasus can only hit one   with his ult.    2.         1. The vice versa positioning is not true. In this case, Maokai would walk up to Nasus. Both Maokai and Ivern would get hit by Nasus ult.    3. In most games, you have to scout where most people place their Nasus, Renekton, Orns/Volibears. But in a few games with hexes, almost everyone places those  s on those hexes and it becomes really easy to use this trick.     4. This trick applies for any ranged frontline (like Ivern, vlad). Mostly used for early game. 2. Putting in only 1   for minion rounds (stage 1-2, and 1-3) to gain an extra gold 20% of the games    1. At stage 1-2, you be should selling your 2-cost you got from the first carousel. Buy a 1-cost  s that can solo the round. This will increases your chances of hitting 10 gold to make 1 extra interest of gold DRAMATICALLY (I probably make an extra gold 20% games)    2. The following  s can solo the round guranteed: Nasus, Renekton, Diana (place her on the right side of the map so she jumps and kills the ranged minion immediately). Vlad can solo the minions most times, but sometimes he crits too much and kills the minion as he drains it and doesn't heal and he'll lose the rounds. Warwick can only solo the minion if you put a belt on him. I don't know about Ivern (if anyone knows, please let me know)    3. Most people don't know this, but the amount of gold you gain in your first 3 rounds is: +3, +5, +4 (not 1 % sure about the +4)    4. The reason why this is so important is because this is a important gold threshold. Counting the 2 gold you get from selling the initial minion. At stage 2-2, you have 5 gold. If you put in 2  s, you have 3 gold left for interest. Riot Mort has mentioned that blue boxes can drop 5 gold or 6 gold, hence you'll never make interest. If you instead put in 1  , you have 4 gold left for interest, any game where you get 6 gold from a blue box, you get to make interest. Or any game where you get 2 grey boxes that contains 3 gold each, you get to make interest. This 1 gold you get at this round is so ridiculously powerful (probably translates to 3-4 gold) by the end of the game.     5. You can apply a similar logic to stage 1-3.    6. I learned this trick from naturesbf :) 3. 4 mystics DOES NOT give diminishing returns vs 2 mystics     1. How magic resists works is that if you have 1 0 hp, adding 40 magic resists gives you 4  additional hp vs magic damage.     2. If you have 1 0 hp going from 40 magic resist (2 mystics) -  120 magic resist (4 mystics) is going from 4  additional hp to 12  additional hp.     3. Why people think there is diminishing returns because they're looking at percentages.       1. imagine a 1 0 hp  . If you put a belt on it, it gets a 20% hp boost (12  hp)       2. If you put another belt on it, it gets a 16.7% hp boost (14  hp), but this is not diminishing returns. It takes just as long for enemies to get through the first 2  hp vs the second 2  hp. 4. Keeping Zephyr  s on the bench    1. When you have a zephyr  , place it on the bench and put it into play at the last second.    2. Opponents can't see items on bench (or rather it's difficult), so they have to mentally keep track that you have a zephyr. With 7 opponents, this is a challenging task. 5. Lining up vs Qiyana    1. If you line up your  s against the left wall or right wall, Qiyana can only hit one   with her ult. This can be done on any row    2.         1. Qiyana will jump to Varus and either target Varus or Malzahar. Her ult will only hit one  .     3. This is most often done due to hexes or locket. 6. Manipulating Singed    1. Singed is a big portion of the meta right now, and if you're facing a stacked singed, there's a few ways you can counterplay it. The key is that singed always runs to the furthest  , and when he gets there, he looks for the furthest   and runs to that   and repeats the process.    2. Countering singed with singed:         1. Your singed will run to their singed, their singed will run to your singed. Once they get to their destinations, they will run back towards each other. Your twitch will be completely safe. This is often intentionally done when their singed is more stacked than yours.    3. Countering singed with assassins       1.         2. Singed will run towards Annie, Zed will jump to the enemy Twitch. Once singed reaches Annie, singed will run to your Zed. Your Azir will be completely safe. 7. Poisoning Assassins with Singed    1. When Assassins are jumping to their target, they can be poisoned by Singed's ult.    2.         1. Zed will directly jump over Singed and get hit by poison.    3. This is very important as it can often delay Zed's first ult cast by about 7 or 8 autos.  8. Using Master Yi and Kindred as backline assassins    1. If you position Master Yi and Kindred correctly, they can actually assassinate backline  s after taking down the initial tank    2.         1. In this case, Master Yi will kill Yorick, then target Varus (instead of Sion), then Zyra, then Kindred.    3. With a Zephyr, this becomes even easier and more OP. Shadow comps tend to build a lot of Zephyrs so this is very helpful.       1.         2. In this case, Master Yi will run past yorick, kill Varus, Zyra, and Kindred.     4. Personal opinion- Master Yi is a very good carry to stack cause you can run 4 mystics with Master Yi carry. 9. Zephyr targetting    1. There was a video released by Bunny Muffins a while back that you can hold and drag the Zephyr  , space back to your board and place the zephyr   at the very last second.     2. Personal opinion- If there's several good zephyr spots in a game, I think you should always use your zephyr to target the strongest person in the lobby you can't beat that you haven't fought in a while.     3. Personal opinion- damage oriented comps (like shadows) tends to   to Zephyr frontline  s.     I think if that even if you only have a tiny edge over the other TFT players, over a large amount of games, that will translate to a huge amount of LP gain. I have a lot of personal opinions about things like items, team comps, etc, that I didn't put into this post. Mainly because I don't think it will help people become better TFT players in the long run. Maybe I can discuss it in the comments if anyone is interested.   Feel free to ask me anything at all. I achieved my personal goal in TFT, so I don't mind revealing my strategies to the public.", "id": "f2kbo9", "num_comments": 216, "created_utc": 1581476477}, 
{"title": "Champ/Trait Org Chart", "author": "Teacaster", "selftext": "# Champ/Trait Organization Chart  Hey everyone, new to the group, but I'm D3 right now and  ed to share some insights I've found while trying to break into Master/Challenger.  *Processing img 5s78b2u1xqf41...*  I've found it useful to not tunnel in on traits or commit too early (before krugs), and to see champs  *for what they bring to the team * aside from just their synergies. We all already do this/know this (it's why we stack some champs but not others) but having them all in chart broken up like this helps me know what champs I should add to my team to make it more balanced, with the goal being able to represent each corner of this chart and have      * Front Line * Utility  * Carry  * CC  While I was making this I was (not really) surprised by the lack of CC champs, and how just about every 1st or  2nd comp has at least one of the 8 champs in the middle \"Core/OP Zone\".  It was also interesting that summoners are a weird class: they  *can * function as a sort of front line, if they can get their summon off, but it's not that reliable in my experience. I think it's interesting that those in the middle (Sion, Naut, Malph, Yorick, Qiyana, Mumu, Singed, Taric) aren't necessarily  *just * OP because of their kit, but because of the holes they fill on your team/balance it out. Also interesting that the majority of utility is found in traits, as opposed to champions, which is the opposite of last patch, where they were found in items. Last patch also had CC carries like Liss and Kenen, but almost none of the carries in this patch have that sort of impact, besides maybe Mage Malph or a stacked Yorick or a perfect build Shadow Sion 3.

{"title": "Finally hit challenger playing exclusively ocean mages. Here's what I learned!", "author": "tftidiot", "selftext": "Link to lolchess for proof:      For the past week, I've been pretty much exclusively playing ocean mages and have been finding a lot of success. I always force one of 2 variations of this comp, which is either Brand carry or Lux carry depending on how contested Brand is in the lobby.   Items:  My item priority for the first carousel is typically: Rod, Belt, Sword, Tear, Vest. I never contest spatula because I think hitting morellos is more important due to the number of light players in this meta, and without the healing reduction the matchup feels unwinnable. Extra belts can be turned into Zephyrs.  Guardian Angel is super important on Taric but also very good on Malphite or Nami. Zephyr is op and I find Seraphs to be significantly better than Shojin unless you get stuck with a hurricane for some reason. Part of this is that I find Seraphs to be better on Lux so I try to keep that option open.  Spats are extremely good if you already have Morellos, and I prioritize Mage cap over fon when I have the luxury to do so. 6 mages are extremely powerful but I don't think they are worth it unless you have at least 2 mage caps for your CC  s. Never go for Spat on stage 4 if you can't immediately use it as there's a good chance it just becomes useless.  Early Game:   Just like any early game, play any 2  s you can find and make crucial items asap. My favorite early game item holders are Nasus, Neeko (if 3 woodlands), or Renekton. Also, I hold any ocean mage pieces I get even at the cost of econ because I don't think you can afford to delay hitting 2  s in the current meta. This means that I'll keep 2 Vlads and 1 Taliyah on the bench even if I'm at 9 gold and not currently using them.  NEVER go for early game Zyra carry because even though she uses Morellos very well, by the time she casts it's usually too late for it to really matter. On that note, also never put items on Syndra because you   to move items to a carry asap and you can't sell Syndra while keeping 4 oceans in the mid-game. If I high-roll early, I usually level to 5 at 2-5 and potentially even 6 at 3-1 to keep the streak. Usually, I value health   Econ.  Mid Game:  One thing I do is always level to 5 on Krugs, even at the cost of econ. I found that there was never a case where I don't level or roll a bit the round after, so the extra level 5 roll on 3-1 is helpful.  s like Azir or Annie can help get you through the mid-game, but I NEVER contest Yorick as it's too expensive and the odds of hitting Yorick 2 with 4 light players in every lobby is just not worth it. Also, don't be greedy with your Neeko's. If I hit Brand early with a Neeko I'll typically just roll for it. Really important to not be greedy and keep your health as high as possible.   Taliyah is absolutely broken and is a must keep for the comp to work. Mountain buff can carry you through the mid-game and her ult can win rounds if it hits a carry.  Late Game:  Surviving to late game with ocean mages usually means a top 2 game. Brand does more than enough damage by himself and the amount of CC that the comp brings is usually enough for him to survive until the end. Always keep Taric as Taric with a Guardian Angel will literally carry you through fights. Taric 2 with GA and 4 oceans can usually cast 2-3 times a fight.   I prefer Brand 2 over Lux 1 in all cases, and if I'm going for 6 mages I just won't keep Lux at all. The only time I play Lux is if I find Lux before Brand 2 or if I don't have a mage cap. Worst case scenario, you drop mages completely and just play Lux carry with a strong front line.      Thanks for reading :)      TLDR: You can force Ocean Mages, Zyra sucks, Yorick is a bait, Mystics OP, Taric might be the best   in the game", "id": "ewu53e", "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1580501459},

When i coach plat and below players I often see so much priority on rolling. If you're in these elos, using the fast 8 strategy is a way to play for the late game when no one else in your game will be drafting or managing their money well enough to punish you in the midgame anyway. It's a tough way to play because it requires you to know when to pull the trigger and  t rolling along with rolling quickly. It also requires you to stay calm while you're losing HP but it's BY FAR the most effective way to play the game as a Plat or below player. You may takes some 8th places if your rolling is too slow or you're waiting too long to  t rolling but everyone i've taught to do this has seen huge increases in winrate when they get the hang of it.

{"title": "Hidden Best Top 1 Comp in the Meta, a Challenger's Poison Ranger Guide", "author": "rofflecake", "selftext": "**Warning, long and detailed post**  **TLDR: build towards the below comp while econing and playing the best team available, don't int for any items, roll at 8 if doing ok, roll at 7 if dying.**  This is typically a good version of what the final build looks like    Hi, my name is rofflecake, a mid challenger player on the NA ladder. I have been browsing this subreddit for a while now and gained a lot of insight in my gameplay throughout the two seasons. For once finally feel like I have some useful things to share with the comm y, thus I am making this guide.  I was a grandmaster player in season 1, and bouncing between GM and challenger for the most part this season. I used to do the safe thing of learning to play everything at a reasonable level and just play what the game gives me, to try to top 4 every game. It worked to an extent, but I hit a wall in grandmaster and was somewhat stuck. I had good knowledge but not precise enough to play every comp at the top level; also was at only about 15% win rate overall. Then I found **Poison Ranger**, a completely different approach. I would still only top 4 at an average rate, but once I hit top 4, could easily top one most of my games. I think the reason for this is that the 4 gold rangers and the reliance on 5 gold  s makes this comp scale insanely well into the end game and pretty much out scales every other meta comp, assuming everything is 2  red.   Here is my profile for reference:    This is not a new comp by any means (crit-twitch has been a thing for a while now) and I don't think I am playing this optimally either, so I think with some comm y refinement the build can get even more streamlined. Perhaps because it is relatively under played (at least in challenger), it is IMO one of the best comps to climb and win right now. Also not calling it Crit-twitch and instead poison ranger because I don't believe twitch is the only viable carry in this comp (it is the better of the two) but if you are stuck with a lot of bow items, Ashe usually is the right one to stack first here. What I do consider not interchangeable is the poison synergy. I have tried a lot of different ranger comps this season (4 warden, lunar, 6 ranger, 2 ranger), and the 4 ranger poison version is by far the most consistent and meta countering.  **Early game**  **First carousel:**  Go for brawler's glove, BF sword, or bow.   Potential: brawler's glove   BF sword   bow (in the context of this comp)  Flexibility:   Bow   BF sword   brawler glove (in the context of this comp)  Brawler's glove: In terms of potential, brawler's glove has the most upside because you   three crit items here (2x IE and 1 LW), but it is least flexible and less suited for Ashe carry games (one LW is still good on ashe).   BF Sword: Need two for IE, can also make GA for front line tanks or back line main carry if there are a lot of assassins around, usually you would just position safe and put GA on your amumu or taric.  Recurve bow: need one for LW and can make a wide range of other good ranger items (static shiv, guinsoo's rageblade, RFC, hurricane). Usually if you get a lot of bow early, consider an Ashe carry game instead. Usually if I get a bow in first carousel and get a tear naturally from first monster round, I will just make a static shiv to carry me through the early and mid game.  **2-1 to 2-3**  I never try to int on purpose with this comp because it doesn't require any specific item (pretty flexible item wise), so put in the best team available without leveling or rolling, prioritise 1 gold wardens and rangers. Best team available here is somewhat item context based because if you have an IE, LW or shiv early, a 2   vayne or diana is going to be better than a 2   zyra, different from what other comp would consider the best team available. (look for 2   Leona, nasus, ornn, vayne, diana here). You can put in the woodland package if you find a lot and can 2   them, but they will probably come out earlier than they would have in other comps. Sell  s for gold if needed, but feel free to 2   2 gold  s if they will stay in for a while, and even really good 3 gold  s like azir or karma (sivir 1 has really under performed for me in this comp as a early game item carrier). Ideal early game is something along the lines of 2 warden, your items on a 2   early game item carrier, and some synergy support around that, varus or kindred if the carrier is vayne, 3 inferno synergy, karma to buff your item carrier. Put in any 2     otherwise.  **Second carousel**  Look to complete an item based on what you have so far, get a bow or sword if you got a glove early, glove otherwise, completing an item is important here and allow you to stack this   with another component piece. If you are win streaking early and don't have much of a choice, take anything that builds into one of the final items you   (piece for morello, tear for early static if there is nothing else relevant, if you have lots of chain vest and giant belt, just make a bramble vest or warmog for your wardens as they are fine items for the final build to make sure amumu and taric ults). If you have a belt and a cloak, feel free to make zephyr out of that and use that throughout the game. Morello is very nice for singed in the end game, but it is not super important as it is for some other comps (ranger kills pretty fast and the burn damage is not very relevant, it is really just for light comps in the current meta).   **Mid game**  **2-5 to 3-3**  Level on econ intervals while playing the best team. This means going to 5 on 3-1 and try to have 50 gold left over, or at least 40, if you are under 44 gold at 3-1 before leveling to 5 then it usually means you did something wrong econ wise, or you have a lot of power in your  s (2   azir 2   sivir etc). I would only consider rerolling here if I am at 2 vayne and 2 leona and vayne has items, basically something very easy to find and give a pretty big power boost once found, and at most roll a few times and use probably 10 gold. Level to 6 at 3-2 or 3-3 If you have the gold left over at the gold interval after (40 or 50 gold after rolling). I would consider leveling to 5 or 6 at the 30 gold interval if I am on a big win streak, but not otherwise. Never roll to keep the win streak unless it is in the specific case mentioned above, and get your power boost from leveling instead. If that means losing your 7 game win streak, then so be it. It is super important to get to 8 in this comp, whether it is at 4-1 in a super good econ game, 4-3 in a normal econ game, or 5-1 in a game where you had to roll at 7 to stay alive. In terms of  s to look out for, look for the two 4 gold rangers, malphite, complete your 2   kindred / varus, or pick up a 1   ezreal to temporally get your 4 ranger buff. The whole 3rd stage is about picking up  s you   for final build while still putting out a strong team.   **Third Carousel**  Hopefully you have at least 1 main item done after this and parts for your second main item, this means IE + bow or glove, static + IE etc. It is very normal to get a bunch of defensive items instead, which is completely fine and put them on tanks now, just look for the IE LW and bow items later on.  **3-5 to 3-7**  3-5 is the very first point where I would consider actually rolling for my  s, but only at specific conditions:    Low health, losing to everyone, board is very weak    Only roll after leveling to 7, never at 6, at least 30ish gold after leveling to 7    Specific board would stabilize after getting 1   twitch, ashe, or malphite (making tank line a lot stronger)  Essentially rolling at 3-5 means I am not trying to top 1 this game and playing for top 4 instead. I   to stabilize and even if I lose, to get 5th or 6th instead of 8th. Econ wise I would not hit 8 until 5-1 at the earliest and likely not have poison this game. This is completely the right play to do in a lot of games, but I think most people panic roll too often. I have probably done this once or twice in 1  games of this comp.   **4-1**  4-1 gets separated out since it is an important decision point. In a lot of games, you would need to level to 7 and roll at this point, essentially any game where you are not doing well and didn't hit a lot of things you need naturally. The difference between rolling at 4-1 and 3-5 is that you can realistically look to 2   your main carries (twitch / ashe) and if you hit them, you usually will stabilize till you hit level 8. Sometimes it is ok to roll a little bit here to hit 1   only, then keep your econ for 8 at 4-3, and do most of your rolling there. It really varies from game to game and how strong your tank line is. If the tank line is strong then 1   backline carry should be fine before level 8. Rolling all the way down means again you will probably hit 8 at 5-1, which is fine but usually not correct.  **4-2 to 4-3**  Most games, if your life is middle of the table and you have decent  s mid game, you will level to 8 at 4-3 (4-2 is less often) and do your main roll here. Same as other rush 8 comps, you are doing this to look for the 5 gold  s (amumu taric singed) and also higher chance of hitting your key 4 gold  s. A typical econ game you should have 75 to 80 gold at 4-3, use 40-44 to level to 8 and have the rest to spend on rolling and buying. Look for the  s in the final comp, as well as malphite. Malphite 2 will usually last until at least one of the main tanks is 2  , (1   amumu and 1   taric is too squishy sometimes and will die before they ult). So typically, run malphite 2 with amumu 1, keep taric on bench until amumu is 2   or taric is 2   then bring it in. I would run malphite 2 and taric 1 instead of the amumu 1 if the main carry of the game is ashe. Poison is very important so if you don't find a singed, running a random kogmaw is usually the right play over a 3rd tank, unless that 3rd tank is very good (2   malphite, 2   amumu, 2   taric).  **Late game**  **Fourth carousel**  Pick for the   if you really need a singed or amumu. Usually it is not worth taking taric because you should have other warden to tank in the mean time. Taric is also not very good until two  , which then becomes the best   in the comp. Pick items to complete the items for your main carry. If there isn't anything to useful to make, you can stack the other carry (ashe or twitch) instead or make a morello for the eventual singed. Morello can go on malphite or nasus in the mean time. If there really isn't a good morello carry in the comp, feel free to just put it on amumu and have that be your anti healing in this particular game.  It is usually fine to spread out your items if they don't synergize with each other too much (IE LW twitch, static guisoo ashe) and just look for good complete items in 5th stage or monster round.  **4-5 to 4-6**  Usually I don't roll on these rounds unless I am very close to 2  ring my main carry. Instead, save the rolling for after the monster round. If you are still level 7 on survival mode, feel free to keep rolling here, or save for 8 at 5-1 if you have stabilized.  **5-1 to 5-3**  Level to 8 if not 8, roll as needed. Find missing 5 gold  , or two   all the  s you can. If everything is two   and you really don't need anything you can  t saving for 9, usually this is not the case and level 9 is not super important in this comp (no real synergy added, just another good 5 gold   or a lux).   **Fifth Carousel**  Pick up any 5 gold   u need for 2   or 1   if needed, pick up good attack item for carries if they are not max itemed, or tank item for frontline.  **5-5 to 5-6**  Save here if you have big plans for money at 6-1 (level to 9 or big roll for 2   5 gold  s). You can roll here if you are 1 away from hitting amumu 2 singed 2 or taric 2. Most games by this point in challenger, only 4 players are left, so you are already gaining LP, and since this comp scales very well, this is very likely a win for your now.   **6-1 and beyond**  Level to 9 if you  , usually 2   5 gold   is more important. 9th   here is ideally crystal lux, but any lux will do. Nami is fine as a 9th   as well. Or even another 1   amumu or singed running the opposite direction.  **Some common questions:**  Q: Finding 5 gold   is hard, I can't find amumu / singed / taric!  A: They are needed for a win, but you can top 4 with 2 or even 1 of them. I have quite a few wins that only had kogmaw, and malphite instead of one of the tanks. The tanks only go in to replace another 2   tank, so it is not as if your frontline is completely empty without them.  Q: Which of the three  s is most important to two  ?  A: Taric 2 is probably the biggest game winning   for the comp; it is very hard to lose with taric 2 against most meta comps. Amumu 2 is also very good to ult consistently. Singed if positioning well, shouldn't die before spreading poison around even at 1  , but of course still pick it up if you see it. If you need to neeko one of them do taric   amumu   singed. Neeko twitch or ashe first though if you are dying and need to stabilize.   Q: What does this lose to?  A: It has a good match up against most things once the build is complete, it loses to weak mid game and not finding key  s (2   twitch ashe) when down rolling. If assassin is popular again, it is probably weak to assassin, but the current meta favours the strongest front to back comp, and this is one of the best because it has backline penetration along with stall tactics in strong wardens and poison. Against BM Azir and Soulbound, it wins most games late if everyone is around same level. You might lose to unfavourable azir soldier or many 3   carry or 3   Lucian, but most games you should win once the tank line is established and items on backline is complete. If you find your main carry moving forward too far against berserker, feel free to just corner it on the opposite side of olaf. The khazix will not kill your carry solo and will ult to someone else half way. Poison is also very strong against all the mage and caster type of builds as well as getting most opposing taric and amumu killed before they ult.  Q: This comp is not as good as BM Azir and uses a lot of the same items, why not play that instead?  A: I don't think BM Azir is as good as people claim it is, it is very good and can top most games as seen by top of the ladder but there will be another 8th place finish that people don't really see in the same game. Ranger is lightly contested right now and IMO has a stronger end game after 6-1. It is also not spat reliant and you will always get something useful at first carousel.  Q: What do I do with spat in this comp?  A: Honestly, not much. FoN is not even that good because the synergy caps at 8 and you   to hit 8 to even roll for those  s. It is useful to have mid game power spike of 1 more  . The only actual spat item I would make is cinder on singer to watch it burn things, or warden mail to make one of the side rangers more tanky to assassins. If you get a spat first carousel, play another comp instead for that game.      I will be streaming this comp   sometime this weekend on a secondary account to see how many games it would take me to hit challenger from scratch.

{"title": "Top 5 Beginner Friendly Tips", "author": "CosiestKitten", "selftext": " Hey guys, CozyKitten again. Author of this post: (  I figured it would be nice to write a up a beginner friendly guide for those just  ting out   these are definitely things I wish I knew when I was first learning TFT. While these are geared towards beginners, some of you may still be guilty of making some of these mistakes!    _ _ _ _  **1.** **Don't roll for no reason and don't roll too early!**   This is a mistake I see many, many players make at all elos. A good rule of thumb is to NEVER roll at Stage 2 (unless hyperrolling at Krugs). This is super important because this is directly tied to how effectively you can econ (earning 1 gold per 10 gold you save up, up to 5 gold of interest).  At lower elos, games are won or lost simply off better econ. Think of it this way, more gold = more potential power, if you get to spend more gold than everyone else in the game, chances are you'll be much stronger than everyone else as well.  The best times to roll are usually right after you level so that you can powerspike with higher tier  s. When you think you're strong enough to sit and econ for the next level you should stop rolling.  **2.** **Don't go for 3  s!**  THE biggest mistake I always see beginners make is always going for 3    s. The lower the elo, the more 3    s you see everyone making, at the highest elos people RARELY have superfluous 3    s that don't outright win them the game.  The reason for this is simple: going for 3    s costs you econ. And econ is SO important that going for 3  s is rarely worthwhile unless:  A) You're so far ahead it won't cost you anything.  B) You highroll so hard it doesn't cost you econ.  C) The 3     (i.e. Sivir) will outright win you the game.  **3.** **Use your items!**  Letting all your item components sit on the bench until you have all your perfect items and your perfect  s is a sure fire way to throw the game. People often undervalue the immediate impact that just jamming items can have on your long term prospects for winning the game. It can save you so much HP early on that it gives you more breathing room later   often times this is the difference between going 4th and scraping out a 1st.   You should ALWAYS make an item immediately if it is an item you know you   and is core to your team comp. For example, you know you're going a Sivir comp and you have Red Buff on bench. You should always make it, even if you don't currently have a Sivir to put it on. You should put it on someone you know you're always selling later on.  **4.** **Don't clump your  s!**  This tendency gets really punished by a few things: AoE, CCs (which are usually AoE), and Berzerkers. By giving your  s breathing room, it makes it harder for enemy  s to easily hit multiple  s with their abilities or attacks.   Vs assassins you usually   your carry in the back middle with  s far left and far right in the back so the assassin never jumps on your carry first.  **5.** **Level timings**  Lastly, this is a VERY general outline for when you should be a certain level. If you find that you are consistently missing the mark on these timings, it's most likely because you're not econing efficiently (keeping too many  s on bench, spending too much on rolls).   If you can consistently make these timings you will almost always be stronger than your average opponent in Gold and below. By Plat, most people should know these timings by heart. By Diamond, you should know when you can/should deviate from these timings.  Level 5: By end of Krugs  Level 6: 3-2  Level 7: 4-1  Level 8: 5-1   _ _ _ _      I hope some of you find this useful!

Plenty of people are building it, it seems to be strong this patch. I hit D4 last patch on two accounts (and a few more into plat), and am currently at P4, climbing pretty steadily having abused 6 inferno / 2 ocean and Blender last patch.  ### When to run this comp  You need a spatula off the first carousel to make this comp work, if you don't get one by the second carousel, you can still run 6 light with soulbound, but you might not be able to get lunar and mystic up.  ### Final Comp  - Leona - Vayne - Nasus - Senna - Karma - Soraka - Lucian - Yorick  ### Item Priority  - Spatula - BF Sword - Negatron Cloak - Giants Belt - Tear  ### Stacking priority  You   to prioritise stacking Senna and Lucian. In the early game, look for Senna items, definitely prioritise getting Talisman of Light over anything else.  ## Gameplay  ### Levels 1 - 5   s to look out for:  - Leona - Vayne - Nasus - Senna - Karma - Soraka  Don't roll, you   to save your gold here.  Level after the first carousel.  If you have only 1*  s at krugs, roll max 10 gold to try to find a 2*, try to stay above 40 gold here.  ### Level 6  Level to 6 at 3-2.  Don't roll at level 6.  ### Level 7  Level to 7 at 3-4, after the second carousel.  Roll enough gold here to see you through to level 8, try to gauge how well your team is doing against the rest of the lobby, if you can keep 10-20 gold after rolling you're on track to hit level 8 either after the next carousel or at 5-1.  ### Level 8 and beyond  Level to 8 when you have enough to level and 30+ gold to roll with, if your build is contested or others are hitting 8 before you it might be worth levelling with only 20 gold to roll so you can get to important  s first, like Lucian or Yorick.  Once you've hit level 8 you should try to all in, this is where your build plateaus. If you're super strong and consistently beating everyone else in your lobby / have high HP compared to everyone else you can try to econ to 9 here to squeeze another   in and shoot for first place.", "id": "enfxst", "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1578788540},

{"title": "Top 5 Tips to (almost) Instantly Make You a Better Player", "author": "CosiestKitten", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm CozyKitten, a previous high Legend Hearthstone player, turned TFT player. I'm a 2x Masters (81 and 56 games to Masters) from Set 1. Always been a fan of contributing content to help others get better so hopefully these tips will find some use. While most of these are geared towards lower ranked players, the first tip will be relevant to players as high as Diamond. Hope you enjoy!   _ _ _ _  **1. Econ econ econ**! Econing well can be the sole difference between getting 7th or 1st. Good econ alone can also carry you from Silver to Gold, Gold to Plat etc. While most people already know to econ, being strict about selling  s that aren't core to your comp to get one extra gold (especially early on) REALLY adds up over the course of a game.  One KEY spot for making econ comes during the round of PvP right before carousel. Often times, right before the second carousel you'll find yourself at 17 or 18 gold. If you pick a 3 or 2 cost   from carousel you can actually sell it in time to make one extra gold of interest for the next round (it is easiest to do this by immediately going back to your bench after you've picked and just mash the hotkey for selling  s so you don't miss the window). If you can remember to consistently do this, it will instantly make you a better player.  **2.** Speaking of **using hotkeys**, if you aren't already you should pretty much always be using hotkeys to sell (E), level (F), and roll (D). If you don't like the default hotkeys you can always change them in the Hotkeys menu. By using hotkeys to perform those actions, you have way more time to focus on actually thinking and doing your turn. Those precious seconds really add up especially during rounds where you need to be leveling and rolling to transition into a late game comp.  **3. Climbing with one S tier comp**. The one question that gets asked in every top player's stream without fail is:  if I   to climb should I stick to one comp?  The answer is unequivocally  YES!  In fact, many top players will only play 1 or 2 main comps every patch, so this strategy is valid up to the very highest ranks.  The lower rank you are, the more I'd recommend sticking to one comp. The reason for this is simple, you learn much faster if you play the same comp over and over again. If you consistently make the same mistakes, it's much easier to spot if you're playing only one comp. Things like item prioritization,   prioritization, transitioning, and positioning become much clearer when you know what comp you're playing.  The downside of course is that it can get a little monotonous, so pick a comp you enjoy playing. Ultimately, it is by far the best way to learn and learning is what makes you a better player. By the way, if you get  hardstuck  hard forcing one comp and you're not Challenger, it's most likely because the rate at which you climb has exceeded the rate at which you're learning.  **4.** **Never blame RNG**. Blaming RNG is a losing attitude that holds you back from learning and improving. It is the easy way out of getting better. THERE IS ALWAYS something you could have done, however minor, to improve how you played your last game. Sometimes simply missing one gold of econ could be the difference between one extra roll to hit that critical 2     and the difference between a 7th and 1st. By keeping your mind open to these possibilities, you limit the reasons for becoming  hardstuck.  Always give yourself room to critique your own play. The moment you stop asking questions is the moment you stop learning.  **5.** **Watch other top players/streamers.** This might be the best and fastest way to learn, even faster than playing. When I first  ted playing TFT (my first autochess game), I went from Iron to Diamond elo almost exclusively from watching streams over the course of just a few weeks. By copying streamers as much as you can in how they econ, transition, position, and itemize you learn far more and far faster than trying to figure it out on your own. And when you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask why!   _ _ _  If any are interested I also stream at:   I'll be on around 7:15 PM PST today memeing from Bronze to Masters and trying out new builds/items (Iceborn Ezreal anyone??).

{"title": "Gameplan for climbing elo in 9.24b", "author": "lukesea27", "selftext": "Hi everyone,  If you are like me who came from set 1 and seem to be struggling with set 2, I get it. I too couldn't figure out the meta and was hard stuck diamond for some time. But intentionally reading reddit and watching streamers, finally something clicked and I got top 2 for over 10 games and ended up in challenger last weekend. Because it was really frustrating to be hard stuck, here are some specific strategies that I learnt getting to challenger and resources will be found at the bottom.  Forcing comps- For 9.24b, I only forced 3 S-tier comps. Blender, Ocean mage   6 Infernos. I only play blender if I can get spat in the first carousel. This does 2 things: deny someone else from blender   an easy top 4. Forcing blender without spat is risky and I don't recommend it. I think for people like me who don't get a lot of time to play the game, forcing builds is the best way to climb as you won't be confused by the different comps you can go for as you roll down.  If there is no spat, I go for rod as it builds into both morello and locket. The aim of the early game is to get strong early  s/synergies. I pick up wardens/woodlands/inferno/ocean  s. The most desired  s are nasus, zyra   syndra those 3 with morello can often carry you. Try to aim for a strong mid game comp (lvl 5): 2 warden 3 inferno, 4 ocean 3mage, 4 warden +  , etc. Do not roll until you get to level 7 after wolves. The only situation where you roll at 6 is if you think you will go below 50hp before wolves or many pairs. For every round that you are not rolling, 2 things you need to constantly be aware of. How can I improve my board and are there any  s that can I can sell on my board/bench that allows me to hit the next interest goal. Sounds simple enough but in that 30 second window how well you do these 2 things shows up in your final placing.  How to decide to go for ocean mage or 6 infernos?  I chose these 2 S-tier comps as they have many crossover  s (naut/thresh/brand/zyra/annie/amumu). So how do you decide which to go for? It is very often a judgement call based on what items you got and what  s you have before rolling down. Ocean mages need deathcap and some mana item for a 2  red brand, playing it with a non-upgraded brand is terrible. If you have a lot random items like bows, going inferno will be better. But ultimately the decision is gonna be based on what you already have on the board (upgraded kindred or upgraded syndra), you get the idea.  But wouldn't this hurt your economy?  Yes to a certain extent, that is why hitting interest points is very crucial and choosing one comp asap. But since both comps have overlapping  s and items, it is still alright. The benefit of holding more  s is a better chance of hitting upgrades since you won't be rolling until 7 and offers some flexibility in decision making. Say you hit a kindred 2 early, great! 6 infernos it is and you can sell away the mages. Speaking of econ, a lot of times selling pairs in the early game is often the right choice unless they form part of the comp.  Ending note: a lot of things I mentioned are not new and might be dated (idk the meta moves so fast) but I belief once things click for you, you will be surprised how fast it is to climb to the next rank.  **Common resource (huge shoutout)**  How to get carousel item every time: Under settings bind your right click to one of your keys. Spam that key and your mouse, you would often be first into the circle vs someone who only spams right click.

You may know me from this post [here]  or from my random comments on the subreddit. I'm currently [challenger]  on NA and have two other accounts (one is [diamond 3]  with a 50% wr  and one is [diamond 3]  with a 40% wr). I've been getting a few messages here and there on what  s to play early to mid-game and I figured since I have a lot of free time during the holidays right now that I'd write up a comprehensive   tierlist for the current patch and give my thoughts on each  . I think things have slowly changed in the past few days, especially in NA challenger.  I'd really love to hear everyone's input on what they think of the tierlist. If you disagree with something, let me know below! I'm really interested in what things I might not know about a certain   and how they might be stronger/weaker than I originally thought. Also, keep in mind that these are my personal thoughts and experiences with the challenger meta in NA; as such, I will be biased and may have extremely differing opinions on certain  s. Please be respectful when commenting. I've been getting a few very rude messages lately and I'd appreciate it if you guys be a bit kinder in your responses/questions. Thanks :)  Also, one last thing. This is not a tierlist you should use to pick  s with. Context is very important as well. Sometimes a D-tier   should still be played because of your comp. For example, I rate warwick down below as a D-tier  . However, you will still play him for the predator buff! This just means that the relative strength of the   itself is bad. It doesn't mean the   should never be played!

Has everything you could ask for from a  : good tags (inferno + assassin) and really good stats on her ult (level 2 = 4  dmg, 250 hp shield). What's even better is her ability to jump to enemy carries and kill them in the early to mid-game due to her assassin tag. She also spreads inferno really well due to her ult. **Basically she's over-stated and has good tags.** * Zyra - despite pretty big nerfs, zyra remains as a dominant 1-cost  . Has decent stats and insane scaling with items. She holds items such as morello and shojin extremely well, which can then be transferred to other late-game  s. **Basically, she's THE item carrier and has good tags.** * Nasus - extremely tanky and strong ultimate. Light is pretty much a dead tag, but given his amazing ultimate and warden tag, he is one of the best early game tanks in the entire set. He also abuses morello insanely hard, even moreso when you have GA and/or locket as well. **Basically, he's the best early game tank that also does insane damage with morello.**  Note: As you can see, two of the S-tier 1-cost  s are inferno  s, which makes the 3 inferno synergy ridiculously strong right now. Having one or two of these  s alongside a varus + kindred makes for a very strong early to mid-game comp.  **A tier**  * Kog'maw - super strong   with insanely strong tags. If left untouched, he can do insane amounts of damage with the right items. More importantly, his predator and poison tags make him a comp defining  . The only reason he is not S tier is that he is not very good when he's played as a standalone  . **Basically, he's a comp defining   that can hard carry as long as you have the pred and/or poison synergies in.** * Vladimir - strong pseudo tank given that he heals himself with his ult. Can hard carry early-game fights, especially when given items such as locket or dragon claw. Strong tags as well. **Basically, he's a strong pseudo tank with good tags.**  **B tier**  * Maokai and ivern - strong together and barely passable as standalone  s. Druid tag is broken early game as long as the enemy doesn't have morello/stacked kindred/stacked inferno  s. **Basically, as a pair, they provide very strong frontline, but little to no damage. Alone, they are terrible.** * Taliyah - very underrated   imo. Very strong cc ability that can carry you in early to mid-game fights. Super strong with mage synergy completed and mountain buff is insanely good mid-game and even a bit into the late-game. She's also a decent item holder and with a tear or on ocean maps, she can insta-cast ult which is huge. **Basically, she's really strong with her synergies completed and with a tear/ocean hex. Otherwise, she is passable.** * Renekton - still a strong   early game due to his ult, especially when stacked with items such as shojin, morello, and/or dragon claw. Desert tag is extremely strong early to mid-game, especially in a lobby with many warden players. **Basically, he's still pretty OP with items, but not S-tier broken (thank god).**  Note: I always caution people getting too attached to woodland  s. They really ruin your economy and the higher up you climb, the more punished you will be for not ecoing well. Sometimes you can get them 2  red and get a good winstreak going, but just make sure you're not giving up too much gold to play them (I almost never play woodland druid  s because of this).  **C tier**  * Ornn - he's like the garen of league: very average and uninteresting. Luckily, his tags are pretty good and he can be strong when paired with an early volibear. **Basically he's useless without his SO, volibear, but at least he provides frontline.**  **D tier**  * Warwick - fodder   for predator tag. Pretty decent   in first few rounds, but becomes super useless alarmingly fast. **Basically, he only lives to fulfill kog'maw's dreams.**  **F tier**  * Vayne - I cannot remember the last time I played vayne. Two worst tags in the game: light and ranger. I would only play her if I get her level 2 AND I get a super early ranger AND I have nothing else to play. **Basically, she sucks.**       **2 COST  S -** the 2-cost  s this set are pretty meh overall and uninteresting so I will be brief here.  **S Tier**  * Thresh - ocean. warden. broken.  **A tier**  * Varus - strong mid-game carry and often overlooked. does insane damage when you have inferno synergy. also, an important activator for kindred with ranger buff + inferno synergy * Malzahar - very strong tags. does lots of damage early to mid game and can counter certain comps early game via minion spam. strong abuser of shojin, especially on ocean maps. * Rek'sai - super strong tags and really good ult early to mid game. very strong tank when you have steel synergy.  **B tier**  * Leblanc - strong   with surprisingly good cc. good with woodlands. * Skarner - really good tags and surprisingly strong tank. good fodder   to keep in the corners against assassins, especially when crystal synergy is online. * Volibear - strong early game   when synergies are online. otherwise, very very bad. also a key component to the 6 berserker comp since his electric tag will save you hp early.  **C Tier**  * Braum - average tank with hit or miss ult. can rarely carry on mountain map with stacked items (but not really in the current meta since infernos melt wardens) * Jax - decent frontliner and really strong ult. best used on cloud maps with iceborne gauntlet (item is not too good tho rn) * Syndra - crucial tags for ocean mage. does average amount of dmg  **D Tier**  * Neeko - takes too long to ult and ults can be very hit or miss. stats are bad as well. * Yasuo - only used in blender comp and to get cloud synergy to counter aforementioned blender comp. decent   but bad tags outside of blender * Senna - really bad rn without her husband. even then, not very good       **3 COST  S**  - really interesting in this set. some really really bad  s here and some insanely broken  s as well  **S Tier**  * Nautilus - ocean. warden. broken. * Kindred - insanely strong tags and stats which allows for her to be a main carry in some comps. Especially strong because of her ability to stabilize your mid-game and allow you to find direction (can go shadow, inferno, ranger, and any combo of these tags). Strong abuser of seraphs. * Qiyana - probably one of the most broken  s ever in tft. Her ult even at level 1 is insane and can swing entire mid-game fights. Her tags are very strong on every map and can fit almost any comp. Strong abuser of shojin.  **A+ Tier**  * Nocturne - a   that many people have come to love or hate. Nocturne is currently a meta defining champion which abuses his sustainability via the blademaster spat. Abuses infinity edge as well. Even without blademaster spat, nocturne can still hard carry with one or two infinity edges in the mid-game. Only reason for not being S-tier is less flexibility in adding him to your mid-game comps. Can't always go nocturne in the mid-game.  **A Tier**  * Azir - a very strong mid-game carry and has the important desert tag that allows you to actually deal with 4-warden comps in the mid-game. Does an absurd amount of damage if left untouched even without items. * Soraka - very very strong mystic   that gets increasingly more value against comps that rely on their ultimates.  **B tier**  * Mundo - very good tank in the midgame and strong at level 1 without any other  s or synergies in early rounds. Usually the morello holder in poison comps until you find singed. * Sion - strong ultimate ability in the mid-game and does a lot of damage with the shadow synergy. * Sivir - key   in the blender comp. Disgusting abuser of hush and runnan's hurricane.  **C Tier**  * Ezreal - strong mid-game carry with seraphs and can be used for glacial synergy with an early olaf. can also carry items for 4 ranger comp.  **F Tier**  * Aatrox - incredibly bad  . was really good set 1 because of demon bonus which allowed him to actually ult. this iteration of the aatrox has really bad tags and almost never gets his ult off. waste of gold to get to level 2 usually. just put him in for 6 light synergy or 4 blademaster. * Veigar - seemingly good ult, but in practice really bad. only becomes decent in 6 mages, which is a very weak comp rn. also needs to be level 3 late-game, but even then is pretty bad most of the time. takes too much gold and items to get online and even then, he's not going to carry you in most games.       **4 COST  S**  - all really strong  s and comp defining as well  **S tier**  * Yorick - incredibly broken  . very overtuned stat-wise ( the minions have 1 0 freaking hp at level 2 and do 2  ad!!!!!), but requires level 2 to really come online. can hard carry through entire mid-game and can be a strong carry in the late-game as well, especially when paired with nami, whose ult buffs all the minions. **Basically, he spams the board with unkillable minions that do insane damage.** * Annie - really strong   that provides frontline with her bear while also doing an impressive amount of damage, especially with inferno buff online. important to note that she is basically the same at level 2 as level 1; you only really upgrade her so that she gains more hp to get her ult off. **Basically, she's an insane   to play mid-game even at level 1 as long as you protect her so she can ult.**  **A+ tier**  * Malphite - insane cc   and very tanky. the mountain tag is also nothing to scoff at even in the late-game as it essentially doubles the hp of a  .  **A tier**  * Brand - still provides good damage and can still hard carry, but really does require a lot of specific  s and items to work. needs 4 oceans to be used a main carry in most cases. can also be a set piece for the 6 inferno comp. * Kha'six - extremely strong assassin in the mid-game and can still do some work in the late-game. desert tag makes him crucial in assassin comps given the ocean warden meta. very item reliant to continue ult chaining to avoid getting one shot. strong abuser of seraphs. * Olaf - really strong   that is severely limited only by his ultimate costing so much mana and the fact that morello/red buff screws his healing. very meta dependent  . rn, he's strong due to him being a counter to blender. also, a strong abuser of hush.  **B/C Tier**  * Ashe - pretty good   honestly due to the crystal tag. can be a main carry in ranger comps and a strong fodder   in crystal comps. overall, decent  . requires a lot of bows to be carry, however (usually shivs). * Janna - strong CC   with micro-stun and surprisingly strong heal provided the enemy does not have morello/red buff. also has good tags with mystic and cloud, making her a good   to tech in. * Lucian - strong  , but requires entire comp to be built around him, which is either shadow/light, both of which are not great late-game rn. also, requires one to get a lot of bows and bf swords (for giant slayer and GA on senna)  **D Tier**  * Twitch - really meh  , but carries important tags so is often used to complete synergies. Otherwise, very unlikely to carry except in really rare cases for ranger comps.       **5 COST  S**  - insanely strong  s with game-changing ultimates/passives  **S Tier**  * Amumu - universally acknowledged as one of the strongest, if not strongest,   of set 2 as of now. his cc covers practically the entire board and his tags made running 4 warden and other comps such as 6 infernos in the late-game possible. * Nami - by far, the strongest support   due to her ult buffing your other  's auto attacks. she can also be used as a main carry with morello, especially at level 2. Has very strong synergy with strong cc  s like malphite and amumu since you can cc chain the enemy and also with summoners since she can buff summoned  s. * Lux - not a 5 cost, but I'll just put her here. lux has always been a strong   to jam into your comp at level 9 for some nice synergies. lately, however, more and more people in high challenger across many different regions have been running lux as a main carry due to her insane damage. she has incredibly high stats and can bring some insane synergies to your comp that you might not otherwise be able to make.  **A+ Tier**  * Zed - love him or hate him, zed is an extremely strong carry provided you have the proper items on him. the reason zed is not included in the S tier is due to his heavy reliance on items to work properly in comps. the  s in S tier do not need specific items and can be put into almost any comp. * Singed - one of the highest dps  s in the game, especially at level 2. very strong abuser of ap items, especially morello. also really disgusting   for spreading poison.  **A Tier**  * Taric - has an insane ult which can change entire fights by providing his team with brief moments of invincibility. the biggest problem with this  , however, is his high mana cost which causes him to die sometimes without ulting. also, the difference between taric 1 and taric 2 is huge, so you will need to invest a lot of gold into making taric 2.  **D Tier**  * Master Yi - overall, a very weak   after shadow nerfs from the beginning of the season. every other mystic is much stronger in providing utility for your comps. pretty much only playable for 4 mystic or in shadow comps. also, used as 4th bm and mystic   in blender.

{"title": "I climbed from Bronze 4 to Diamond 4 in 8 days spamming one comp.", "author": "Mowglyyy", "selftext": "The comp in question is the 6 Infernos comp. I first saw it on a reddit post in this sub, although I forget the user's name. I'll briefly summarize it here for anyone who didn't see it.   *COMP *  Basically it's super simple, you look for ocean first, usually I end up with Syndra and Vladimir (Although all the while looking for both Thresh and Nautilius to replace these two).   Then, you buy everything you can that's infernal, even if it's a shitty ass Diana, who cares just buy it. Anything to get you the inferno bonus, just slap it in behind the 2 Oceans, all the way to level 8. You   to get to 8 fast because you need Amumu to tie everything together, and seeing as he's such a broken   right now, he's contested for most comps.  The final Comp generally looks like Nautilius, Thresh, Amumu, Kindred, Brand, Varus, Zyra, Annie.   *LEVELING *  You level at 2-4, i.e just after first carousel. That way you can -hopefully- put down 2 Ocean 3 Infernos and potentially  t to streak.   Next level is after Krugs, so 3-1 or 3-2.   You level to 7 after the next carousel, so 3-4. At this point you should take a look at your Health. Usually if I'm around 60hp I'll roll down pretty much to 0, or at least until my  s are strong enough to hold until 8. Due to not rolling at all before this and spending most of your gold levelling and trying to econ, a lot of your  s may be 1  . Don't panic, just stick to the plan.  I usually level to 8 when I know I'll have roughly 20-25 gold to reroll with afterwards, and this usually comes around 4-2 / 4-3. At this point you just continue to roll down looking for Amumu or levelling any other  s you haven't 2  'd yet like Annie or Brand.   *ITEMS *  So, with the items you go full defensive, literally don't build a single offensive item. Any time I've tried to mix it up and build ludens on brand or some shit it just all gets fucked, so just stick to defensive items and let infernos do the work.   At first carousel, you   to go for the Rod, because one of your most important items to build is Locket, and you'll more than likely be able to get the Chain Vest for the locket later, so best to pick up the rod now while you have a chance. (You'll   two lockets, so try find another rod at some point on the carousels too.) The lockets both go on kindred, as you'll have 5 of your infernos in your backline and then just the 3 wardens up front.  Next up is Amumu, and here it gets a little tricky. Mostly you just   to build tank items on him so that he gets as many ults off as possible, but I've had some success putting Morellos on him too when vs. Berzerkers or a fat-ass Braum with warmogs. If going for tanky items I usually build Thornmails, Dragon Claw and Warmogs, but change this depending on your lobby, that's just a generic one if the lobby isn't swinging any particular direction and they don't have Morellos.  Finally you can put some items on Annie to help her get tibbers out a bit more consistently, Things like warmogs, GA and redemption tend to work well.       Well, that's it. Here's my lolchess if anyone  s to take a look.     Again, this isn't my own comp or anything, just something I saw here and  ed to show that it does work. I'll answer any questions anyone may have.

{"title": "9.24 Unorthodox Comp list!", "author": "ThaToastman", "selftext": "With the patch 9.24 among us, and the popularity of my [last]  post. I figured I'd draft up a new unorthodox complist!  Based on some PBE time and experimentation as well as a ton of 9.23 playing around, I have found a pretty solid set of interesting comps that, based on champ popularities, are actually super viable and strong. Note: The [Wizardbear]  comp from the last post still works (its even better now),  As a note, the first half of 9.23 I largely forced skarner hypercarry really successfully, and  ted playing warden comps as the \"rush 8\" strat got more popular. Those comps are tested and proven, the lucian ones obviously are not. In experimenting with warden + mountain comps, I found that midgame they were downright unrivalled (no idea why, but even against hyperroll woodland comps, renekton+FH+morellos made them bearable). Of course mage comps proved a little dicey sometimes, but a well-placed qiyana usually handles mage comp's midgame carry pretty well (warden 4, assasin 3 midgame works nice with kha). Given that wardens are basically unchanged (ammumu counts as a buff I guess), these strategies are only stronger.       Comp 1: [Inverse Annie]    [(Variation of Comp)]   Endgame comp: Annie w/ Warden + Shojin + Morello/Gunblade  Taric (Shojin, RFC), Ammumu, Nautilus, Thresh, Malphite, Brand, Ashe/Mountain Qiyana  Variation of Comp: Replace Taric with Soraka, Replace ammumu with Diana (or any other infernal), Replace Ashe with Janna.  This comp is just hilarious. With the aoe infernal shots, Annie becomes a double frontliner AND carry here. Annie should die last each fight, but the fights should also all last 30 seconds. With persistent morellos (and possibly 2-3 tibbers casts), This comp has the makings of being a devastating lategame move team. Especially with the relative reliability of nabbing a warden item from last carousel, in theory you can force this comp just fine, especially as part of a \"rush 8\" strategy. The underrated part here is that the ocean buff will ensure that tibbers will always be haunting the enemy, and annie will stay full HP because of it.  The other perk of this comp is it doesnt really matter you pick as a carry/what items you get. If you only get defensive, great, make a thornmail and warmogs and make one of you wardens a walking reflector. If you only get offensive, mumu, Brand, Annie, and Soraka would love that. Take a lot of damage early? Thresh lantern is NUTS if you get a shojin on a warden comp, as all your  s are in the same place, and thresh's range means that hell be the last to die with decent positioning.      Comp 2: [2nd Amendment Lights]   Endgame comp: Lucian with rageblade, giant slayer, Runaans  Senna (GA, Lightbuff), Soraka, Nami, Thresh, Yorick, Aatrox, Nasus  This isn't likely so unorthodox as much as I fear this will be the scariest comp of this patch.  All you have to do is frontline lucian (to waste the enemy's time), and then watch [this driveby]   His passive is an on-hit dream, and it makes him go full machine gun. One thing, it procs on hit. If you think Olaf is a disaster right now, lucian is a mess because at least olaf was killable. Now you get all the peskiness of light buff, with a GUARANTEED 5.0 attack speed true damage sprinkler. And on top of that, if you   that sprinkler to go away...you have to get through a GA to do it. This is theoretically horrific tbh, not sure if it actually reflects on live though.       Comp 3: [Hail]   This is exactly like the light lucian comp, except it takes a page out of the glacial olaf book. Once again the name of the game is 5.0 attack speed. This time however, we are looking for CC. Yea...please don't play this unless you   8 reports in the post-game lobby for being an asshole.      Comp 4: [Man with Book]   Endgame comp: Singed (Morellos, FH, Warmogs)  Y'all already know this, but like, you could always just play randomass lvl 1 champs and then use T2 Singed with Exodia items. Doesn't really matter at that point, enjoy your first place. They didn't change anything about him so like, feel free to just keep doing this shit.      Comp 5: [Mans Not Hot]  is he?]   Endgame comp: Singed (Morellos, FH, Cinder)  Similar rush-8 strat comparable to the inverse annie comp, just this time Singed is the carry. God I hate this champ.   If you have no warden item, 6 wardens with singed as a 7th (and qiyana 8) works like a charm.   Lvl 9 variant is to toss in 3 poison and drop a warden item on mundo, singed, or qiyana.       Comp 6: [Unsquashable bug]   Endgame Comp: Skarner (Thornmail, Warmogs, Sparky)  Kogmaw (items are optional) (Shiv, Giants Slayer/Deathblade, Runaans), Reksai, Singed/Mundo, Twitch, Ashe, Nocturne  This isn't particularly innovative given the 9.23 meta, but its a variant that I haven't seen anyone but myself run with any sort of consistency (but it netted me 7 first places in a row a few days ago). Most people run kogmaw carry, but imo skarner is far scarier with his exodia build.  This comp is definitely a hyperroll one. Without T3 Skarner, you lose, and of course if you aren't gonna hit T3 skarner, you can always just pray Kogmaw can carry, but of course the assassin guy will take you out. Note: This comp loses BADLY to infernals, so careful playing it this patch. Crystal's main counters are morellos and infernal buff.       Comp 7: [Hunger Games]   Endgame Comp: Diana (T3, IE, Gauntlet, Gunblade)  --Deathblade may actually be better than gauntlet here  The dawn of the Girl on Fire. I did the math in a separate post under the new patch notes, but long story short, with this build, diana on average does 8k single target damage, and up to 5k to adjacent targets IN JUST 4 AUTOS. I'm not sure how it's faring on live yet, but mathematically, this is it chief.   The strat here is just to T3 diana from hyperrolling, and then econ to 8 and just enjoy your top 4.", "id": "e9fw6b", "num_comments": 19, "created_utc": 1576110377},

{"title": "Itemization - dos and don'ts", "author": "Shango89", "selftext": "Something that has always bothered me since Set 1 launched is the itemization certain spreadsheets recommend, or to be more precise how some people apply those. Now before i go into details know that different people use different approaches regarding recommendations for itemization.  1. They recommend the very best (in their opinion) items for each specific champion 2. They recommend itemizations that are more likely to happen (even spread of components)  So if you see something like Jeweled Gauntlet/IE/Deathcap Brand you should be aware that those Items are not ideal (more on that later) the reasoning behind that recommendation is simple that there is not much use for B.F. Swords and Crit Gloves in Ocean Mage (or that the creator is simple missinformed). So lets get some common points covered.  **Jeweled Gauntlet/IE vs. Deathcap/Jeweled Gauntlet vs. double Deathcap**  Case 1: 20 AP, 65% Crit, 275% Crit Mod -  This equals an average Spell Damage increase of 156,5%   Case 2: 105 AP, 45% Crit, 150% Crit Mod -  This equals an average Spell Damage increase of 151,125%   Case 3: 2  AP, 0% Crit -  This equals an average Spell Damage increase of 2 %  TL;DR: When Itemizing your Brand Deathcap is the superior AP item by all means, never strive to complete that Jeweled Gauntlet through your caroussel pick and always aim for additional Rods instead. (even more on that just below)  **How to Phantom Dancer**  This may not hold much relevance in the near future because PD is soon to be reworked but for now the following points still apply.  1. PD does work vs. Jeweled Gauntlet - A fact that some people are still unaware off and even more reason to build Deathcap over Jeweled Gauntlet whenever you can, however PD does not work against the burn effect Inferno  s apply with their Spells if that Spell would have crit. So whenever you find yourself in a situation where you had to build Jeweled Gauntlet on your Brand and someone built a PD on his carry in response - run Inferno. 2. Comp Sheets recommending slapping PD on all your carrys/tanks no matter what - Dont. Scout if no one runs Assassins and no one built Jeweled Gauntlet you do not need to build PD, it is sitll a good item but it does not have priority. If someone built Jeweled Gauntlet -  build PD on your Carry. If someone runs Assassins -  build PD on your corner bait  s (Nami is amazing for this) or on your Carry if you corner him (which you should not, Nautilus is a thing). If someone runs IE on something like a Vayne or Kindred -  build PD on your Frontlaner and position it right in front of the enemy carry.  TL;DR: Scout before building/equipping PD.  **Itemizing Kha'Zix**  Kha'Zix is a great  , however he does have one little problem. He can't damage  s that have PD equipped. So does that mean you should never itemize Kha'Zix? No, but you need another carry that is able to deal with PD wielders. Earlier today i saw a comp sheet that made me post this, it had the following itemization recommendations:  Kha'zix: Blademaster/Seraph/IE - Nocturne: Hush/Disarm/Guinsoo - Yasuo: PD/Iceborn  If you blindly follow that, you wont make it to top4 in most cases, because you simple can't deal with PD. When running Kha'Zix always make sure to itemize any other Carry first.  TL;DR: Never itemize Kha'Zix as your first or only Carry.  **Spear of Shojin vs. Seraph's Embrace**  Certain Guides/Comp Sheets will recommend putting Shojin on Brand/Nami or even Malphite, because they have high mana pools and therefor make great use of the passive effect while Seraph's would not really do much.  Seraph's is better in most cases for one reason: Most  s dont need to cast their ult twice. If your double Deathcap Brand ults, there wont be any  s to ult left the 2nd time, the earlier this happens, the better. Same applies for Malphite, considering you will most likely end up frontlining him he is  not to be expected to use his ult multiple times, if that ult comes in 1 second earlier because of 20 extra mana you might just win that round.  TL;DR: The deciding factor when choosing between Shojin/Seraph's is not some Mana breakpoint, it is in *most* cases how early you   your  s to ult.  I might add more \"main points\" to this later, depending on how this lands, but for now to close this out some short facts/tips that you might not be aware off or changes that you have missed.  **Locket of the Iron Solari**  - While the Shield is still active, your  s cant be poisened.  **Poison/Predator**  - Ionic Spark, Titanic Hydra, Thornmail etc. do all apply the effect. Red Buff/Morello burn does not.  **Guardian Angel/Redemption**  - This interaction got changed last patch and no longer works - dont build it.  **Repeating Crossbow**  - This does not grant crit chance to summons, summoners can only crit if their respective summoners has Jeweled Gauntlet equipped. (Does not apply to Zed)  **Summons**: Those count as Spells and do apply Morello on hit. (Does not apply to Zed)  Good, thats all for now.", "id": "e0xkhg", "num_comments": 70, "created_utc": 1574596145}, 
{"title": "Skarner Carry in-depth", "author": "CaptainCutie22", "selftext": "I've been seeing few posts regarding the Skarner carry build and I just  ed to give input regarding it since I've been spamming this build only last few days (yes including the patch before)  These are my takes and my priority list that might not be exactly the same as some other people.   I think the build is really good just because the spike is at Level 7 (not 8) and is composed of Kog'Maw, Rek'Sai, Skarner, Nocturne, Dr. Mundo (Swapped to Singed whenever possible), Ashe, Twitch. The build requires no tier 5   and it centers around relatively low cost  s.  Level 8 upgrade would be one of the followings: Crystal Lux  Steel Lux  Taric 2.  * Crystal Lux means you lucked out and you'll probably win with 4 Crystal making Skarner the tankiest boy out there. * Steel Lux and Taric are good enough, but if you don't find these, don't freak out too much it's nbd. * As 8th  , you could just add another Skarner/Rek'Sai/Nocturne/Ashe/Twitch as an extra body to tank  Level 9 upgrade would be grabbing 2 Mystics, preferably Janna and Nami. I like the Mystics because it gives all your  s some MR to tank as opposed to wardens that just has armor for those 2 specific  s.  * Not a fan of Master Yi just because I value the CC that the other 2 provide. Janna heal can heal up your Skarner, Ashe, and Twitch. Nami's wave can buff your rangers and give Skarner more time to tank. * If you already got a Crystal lux, I would just add Janna for CC+Heal, If Steel Lux or Taric, I prefer the Mystics.  Item priority  1. Pick up chain vest from round 1 at all times.    **You absolutely NEED thornmail on Skarner.** You're trying to use Thornmail + Predator to make the opponents execute themselves over time. 2. Once you have thornmail, get warmogs ASAP.    Resistances are little pointless in my opinion since Skarner already has crystal bonus. So big damages are still capped at 1  damage anyways. Just get health regen to top his health off at max to extend his lifespan. 3. Get ionic sparks.   Get the Negatron Cloak first and then pray for a Rod. Skarner will live long enough to get so many chances to use his ionic sparks. It's still useful (even though it got nerfed for no reason lol). If no rod, just add some random item to make it something else. Qss wld do i guess. 4. Random spats   Honestly, you never really needed spats in this build, but sometimes u just end with some in your life or get them through carousel/dragon, then what do you do?   If possible, make **Force Of Nature** to hit your level 9 spike faster. Already level 9? Add in a Yasuo for cloud buff for some dodge fun.    If no chance of FON, Make a spat item which increases level 8 option a bit.   Spat item.    Bork on Ashe and add Master Yi (or other blademasters) as a 8th   for little oomph in the damage. Then at 9, you can add another mystic with Yi.   Black Cleaver on Rek'Sai for some dodge, You COULD make 3 berserkers by keeping Mundo and adding in Olaf as 8th, but Singed        Mundo for you to just add other   as the 8th option   Warden's Mail on Rek'Sai for extra tankiness, don't think 2 Warden's gonna be that good for you, just move on   Frozen Mallet on Reksai for extra health, this gives option to add Ezreal or Olaf as a 8th  . Olaf won't be bad because your games will last long enough for him to ult and Ezreal has glacial   Ghostblade on Rek'Sai and add an Assassin for 8th   for back line access (situational)   Mage, Light, and Inferno: Please avoid. 5. Got the dream items on Skarner, now what?   After you put those 3 items on Skarner, you just gotta  t jamming other items into your build somehow.   The other few item carriers are usually, Ashe, Rek'Sai, Dr. Mundo (which will later be sold for Singed)   Ashe item: **Bloodthirster, Ionic sparks, Runaan's Hurricane, Red Buff, Seraph's,** Giant slayer, Titanic Hydra, Rageblade, Hand of Justice, Hextech gunblade, IE   Rek'Sai item: **Thieve's glove,** Zeke's, Locket, Iceborn Gauntlet, Frozen Heart, Warmog's, Trap Claw, Redemption, Zephyr, Repeating crossbow   Singed: **Morello, Frozen Heart**, Zeke's, Locket, Warmog's Trap Claw, Redemption, Zephyr, Repeating crossbow, Thieve's Glove, DClaw, GA, Thornmail     Map differences  On Earth: When you find Skarner, put that baby on the hex long as possible, then just put Reksai, Singed, Nocturne, Ashe, Kog'maw (priority list) to increase health as long as possible.   On Infernal: In the front, put Rek'sai, Mundo, or Skarner if it has a slot left. In the back, put Ashe, Twitch, or Nocturne. If Ashe can have 3 items, i think 3 items are better than infernal hex.   On Ocean: In the front, Rek'Sai, Mundo, or Skarner, In the back, put Ashe, Twitch, or Nocturne as well.   On Cloud: In the front, put rek'sai with IBG and Singed. In the back, put your Ashe or Nocturne on them  early game team composition by level by level  Level 3: 3 Predators   Level 4: 3 Predators + Noc   Level 5: 3 Predators + Ashe + Twitch (if not, then add 1. Noc or 2. Mundo)   Level 6: 3 Predators + Ashe + Noc + Twitch (Mundo is the least prio)   Level 7: 3 Predators + Ashe + Noc + Twitch + Mundo   If you don't find 3 predators early, just try to 2 * something and sit on them for a bit.   At Level 5, I usually roll down a bit to find some missing pieces if I lack, until then, don't reroll ever. I only level at the Krugs if I think I'm going to die. Once I hit above 50 gold, I just use all that money for experience. Don't look for Ashe here, but it's for you to make sure you have couple 2 *  s and have at least 3 predators and Noc.    At Level 7, if you didn't find those key  s, you gotta roll since you're at low hp b/c you've been giving up lots of health for item priority.   Pros of this build  Relatively easy to force imo. I believe this game is easy to climb if builds are easy to force.  Don't require tier 5  .  Cons of this build  Risky early game since everyone loves predator  t.  If heavy AP on enemy, they can wipe out your backline. your Skarner can't 1v9 that hard. (Hence the Mystic for Lvl 9)  Heavily item reliant on the Skarner, others you can manage pretty well.  Tips  Don't 3 * Mundo   Hold on to Warwick until you find the other 3 predators   Don't stress about losing early. You need specific items to win, therefore you need item priority anyways.   Know that Ashe can be pseudo tank against assassins since she is Crystal.", "id": "dzytbp", "num_comments": 57, "created_utc": 1574415790},

{"title": "Hyper Rolling In Set 2", "author": "TFTAtlas", "selftext": "As many of you have come to notice, hyper rolling is far more prominent in set 2 compared to the end of set one where it was more econ heavy and trying to get to level 8 asap. I've been enjoying the hyper roll meta and been pretty successful  at it.  During the early game you   to pick up the pieces for whatever comp you   to hyper roll in. Scouting is much more important this set with the decreased pool sizes. In my opinion, the max number of players that can share a comp is 2. So keep that in mind when deciding what comp to hyper roll. The main comps are Light, Ocean Mages, Predator, Shadow Inferno, Woodland Druids. I typically like to have 2 comps in mind while having a preference on one over the other. For example, if I   to eventually go Light hyper roll  but am getting Maokai and Ivern, I'll pick them up for a potential Woodland Druids hyper roll. Also they are a strong early synergy to help you from tanking hp. That being said ECON ECON ECON is crucial for the beginning and can determine at top 4 or top 8 finish (I'll explain later). So if I have the choice between a 2 * or making that extra interest gold, I always go with the gold.   Scenario:  2 * Maokai on the field with Woodland druids synergy, 2 vaynes pop up in my shop and I currently have 19 gold. If I can not sell anything else on my bench, I will sell my Maokai and pick up the Vaynes because I ultimately   to go Light hyper roll and   that 20 gold interest too.  I guess you can consider this a sandbag, but you get carousel priority which is always nice when you're going to stack your 3 * carry.   Stage 2-9: This is a crucial stage where you should have 40-50 gold. If you cannot kill Krugs, you need to roll to get some 2 * champs. Two 2 * champs or woodland synergy is enough to kill Krugs. Now, look around at the other players, is anyone else trying to hyper roll the same comp as you;  1. Yes BUT they have less gold: Since you have more gold you have more re-roll chances so you can wait until 3-1 to roll.  2. Yes AND they have more gold: I would re-roll down to 10 gold now so you can take their champs to get a head  t   on your competition who econed better than you.    3. No: Lucky you, have fun re-rolling at 3-1.  Stage 3-1: Depending on what happened during Stage 2-9, you're either rolling here or chilling. You   roll down to 10 gold here and not any more.  A common mistake players make here is rolling until 0 which you should not do. The interest from 10 gold is much more valuable. The only exception to this rule is if you are 1 champ away from two 3 * champs, then you can consider rolling past 10 to hit one. After this you are chilling until Wolves.  Stage 4-1: This is the round right after Wolves and you are level 5. Look at your comp, do you still need 1 cost champs or need more higher cost champs. If you still need 1 cost champs roll until you're left with 10 gold. Make sure you have at least 10 gold so you can level to 6. If you need higher cost champs, level to 6 first then re-roll all your gold. You don't roll anymore until raptors.  Stage 5-1: Same deal as 4-1, but this time you need 20 gold to level. So depending on what cost champs you need, you either roll until 20 gold first or you use 20 gold to level to 7 first then re-roll for champs.   That concludes my simple guide :D Feel free to add suggestions and improvements so we can all climb the ladder once ranked comes out this week.", "id": "dyn7mv", "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1574183051}, 
{"title": "Henneky's Ocean Sins (4 Ocean/3 Mage/3 Sins)", "author": "HennekyPKMN", "selftext": "# Introduction  I  ed to post about this comp because it's something I've personally been having success with, but is something I haven't seen talked about at all in this sub - the Ocean Mage/Sins composition. I first tried this comp thinking it was the most counter intuitive strategy possible, but since then I've been able to top 1/2 a majority of games playing this comp. I'm sure, however, that the number of games I've played, especially in normals, isn't a sufficient sample size to say for sure whether this comp is strong or not.  I feel the most comfortable on Cloud   Ocean boards, but the comp is pretty adaptable to most boards, and doesn't require any spats. (though mage cap is nice)  # Reasoning  I've tried a lot of the assassin variants, with things like woodland sins, desert summoner sins, predator sins being some of the better ones I've played. But across a majority of the assassin builds I've played, I've always struggled with things like PD Olaf, that can lifesteal against the non assassin portions of the team, and can avoid crits from main carries such as Kha'Zix. On the other side of things, I've been somewhat unsatisfied with 6 mages, as I felt weak to itemization such as Dragon Claws and Ionic Sparks, as well as having major spells delayed by Poison comps. I felt like Ocean was a strong element with lots of potential, but I felt like some of the mages such as Taliyah were somewhat underwhelming. I was drawn to some of the assassins such as Kha'Zix, Zed, and Qiyana as  s with strong abilities to abuse the mana generation. Morellonomicon on mages could give me a stronger answer to Olaf or Light comps, and Leblanc could serve as a connector between the two archetypes. Another draw to me was having the option to run 3 damage items on Kha'Zix (BT, RFC, IE/GA being the strongest items in my eyes) instead of feeling inclined to slot in a Seraphs.  # Early Game (Stage 2, Levels 3-5)  Throughout early game, I look for  s to work towards the late game comp, as well as consider pieces such as Maokai or Ivern to find wins early. Diana, Vlad, Syndra, and Leblanc are good pieces to pick up, and if you're lucky you can get an early Qiyana. If I find all the pieces and have a couple 2    s or pairs, I will look to spend 8 gold to level after carousel. A comp of Vlad, Syndra, Leblanc, Diana, and Qiyana can comprise a strong early core of Ocean 2/Mage 3/Sin 3. Either Vlad   Syndra or Diana   Qiyana can be swapped out temporarily for Maokai   Ivern/Neeko to use Woodland early. Early items can be placed on Woodland  s, or Diana, who will eventually be swapped out for Kha'Zix during mid game. I tend to prioritize making interest brackets over 3  ring Diana or Vlad, but if they fall into your lap it may be worth picking up.  Level 5 Comps:    # Mid Game (Stage 3   4, Levels 6-7)  At Stage 3-2, (although sometimes I should probably go at 3-1 to preserve winstreaks) I spend a reasonable amount of gold, first leveling to 6, then rolling down to 20, or even 10 gold trying to 2   as many  s as possible and pick up Kha'Zix, Nautilus, and Thresh along the way. At this point, I usually look to transition my Maokai and Ivern into the other pieces if I haven't already. I also look for temporary  s to play Stage 3 - usually matching a strong, temporary filler  's synergy with Qiyana's adaptive. (Brand/Annie/Kindred on Infernal, Yasuo/Janna on Cloud, Malphite/Taliyah on Mountain, Nautilus/Thresh on Ocean) Alternatively, Desert can be run for a little bit Stage 3 is a somewhat uncomfortable point in the game, as the comp cannot reach the key spike of 4 Ocean quite yet.  Level 6 Comps:    At Stage 4, however, the comp comes online, hitting the 4 Ocean spike. (I personally feel as though this is the strongest lvl 7 comp in the game, barring hyperroll comps which don't hit 7 this early) I tend to go in at 4-2, (once again, could probably go in 4-1 as well for streaks) leveling to 7 and then rolling again down to 10-20 gold, looking primarily to 2   Kha'zix and Nautilus. On every board except Ocean, the comp should look the same, but on Ocean you can slot in Brand for one of the Ocean mages.  Level 7 Comps:    # Late Game (Stage 5+, Levels 8+)  I think Late Game is incredibly complex in Set 2. I'm not going to act like I have it perfectly solved for this comp, so I'm just going to offer some options as to what you can do once you reach level 8.   1. Split LeBlanc into 1 Mage, 1 Sin. (Usually Brand   Zed) Would recommend if you have good Zed items - Zed is a very good user of Ocean, and LeBlanc tends to fall off. 2. Thresh -  Nami, Add Janna. Very good on Cloud boards, does weaken frontline but Janna can help keep your mages safe. Nami can also be added in place of a mage if you found a mage cap this game. Mage Nami very good, nice Morello's holder as well. 3. Tech in a Desert. Usually I don't know what Desert to put for this, none of them fit amazingly thematically, but 50% armor reduction helps Kha do just a bit more work. 4. Just find Ocean Lux 4Head  # Itemization  In terms of what I prioritize for Carousel, I usually aim to get a Morellos for Syndra or Brand, and then focus on Kha'Zix items. IE, GA, RFC, BT are the main 4 items I look to build - BF Swords are #1 priority followed by Recurve Bow. Defensive items such as Iceborn can go onto Nautilus, and spare Tear items like Seraphs or Hush can go onto Brand or Syndra as well. Thief's Gloves or Frozen Heart are decent Qiyana items if you have leftovers, but are not #1 priority.  # Conclusion  Thanks for taking the time to read my guide - I hope you give this comp a try or two. I personally think this comp is an A to S tier comp - with the right itemization it can 1st place against almost any composition, and is incredibly effective at consistently getting top 4 due to a powerful level 7 spike. That being said, I'm definitely not playing the highest quality of games right now so any other tests or thoughts would be appreciated :)", "id": "dwil98", "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": 1573777368},

I've been following r/competittivetft for a while, but this is my first post.   I've played a lot of rangers throughout season 1, ending it at Diamond 3/4. When s2 arrived, I kept on thinking of a way to make rangers work again. Well, I kind of didn't, but I've been trying this build to some success: Ornn, Braum, Volibear, Olaf, Ezreal, Kindred, Sion and Zed. I've been able to top 4 consistently, while placing first every now and then.   IMHO, it's a very versatile composition, with lots of potential carriers. Because of that, you can actually use any items you get.   I  t by picking Warwick plus druids or whatever I can 2 *. Then I usually  t transitioning around level 5, with Braum + Volibear (or Warwick 2)  + Ornn + Ezreal + Kindred (Ranger 2/Electric 2/Glacial 3). Things  t getting good after level six, after glacial 4, and from there on, it's all situational. For instance, if I 2 * kindred early, I'll probably prefer Sion over Ornn; while Ornn will be my pick for level 6 in case I 2 * Volibear and aim to make him a carry.   Ideally, I try to build an economy until Krugs and roll after that. The main goal here is to grant a few fundamental  s early - specially Sion and Olaf, even if they're 1 *. If by any chance I don't hit Volibear/Braum and/or at least one ezreal/kindred early, or if I notice they're contested, I roll before.   This comp peaks at level 7, with Ornn + Volibear + Braum + Olaf + Ezreal + Kindred + Sion (Glacial 4, Berserker 3, Electric 2, Warden 2, Ranger 2, Shadow 2).   As for items, I usually pick ezreal for debuffs - ruunan's hurricane + red buff are amazing on him. Kindred is the main damage dealer, with AP and ASPD items. Last items go for Volibear (Hextech/Warmogs) or Olaf (Phantom Dancer/MR/ASPD - debuffs are that important because of glacial 4) , depending on the situation.   At level 8, I'll add whatever I can get - preferably Zed, for the sweet Electric 3, specially if Volibear is stacked. I rarely hit level 9; instead, I try to 3 * Volibear/Kindred/Ezreal.

{"title": "Guide to Unorthodox Team Comps!", "author": "ThaToastman", "selftext": "Hey y'all, I have played over 13  games of TFT in the past few months, and so to keep the game fresh,  I love to push boundaries with my teamcomps. I have noticed an excessively high number of first place finishes so I figured I could share the love with you all!  As a note about my theories, I personally don't like relying on 5 * champs, because you have a high likelihood that youll die before you pull what you need. Set 2 has so many strong 1 costs and exodia 4 costs that there is never really a need to pray for lux or 5 costs. Also, I am big on holding item components as long as possible, so I love comps that come online at 2 items.      Comp 1: WizardBear   Endgame comp:    T3 Voli w/ Mage Hat + Rabadons + Gunblade   Brand, Veigar, Vlad, Syndra, Taliyah/Leblanc, Zed and Ornn      The power here is that voli with mage hat is double casting, and his ability is doing like 1k damage. Due to its effect, if he ults a 35% hp enemy his ult restets. This means that he just walks around perma-ulting because everyone he meets  he chomps for 2k and gets a reset to do it again. Gunblade ensures that he wont die doing this. And then of course the 3 electric makes sure his first cast is a killer due to the 250 splash damage in his first few autos.   This is a standard hyperroll strategy, Econ til 3-1, then roll down to 6 gold, then do the same at 4-1 (roll down  to 10 or until you finish volibear). The goal here is that you prioritize picking up tears and NLRs in the carousel. They are super low contested so you usually can get 2 or 3 from carousel rounds if you  . Also consider losing the first round or two so that you can cop a spat.   This comp transitions nicely into a standard mage comp (6 mage 4 hydro is best) if you dont get a spatula, and since you've been hoarding tears, and NLRs, Brand or Veigar would be more than happy to take the items if you cant snag T3 voli.   Use spare chain vests and mantles on making disarms and zephyrs. Stopping an enemy from attacking for a second can be the difference in your brand getting nuked before he ults or not. Warmogs of course is not a bad pick. Zekes is solid too but normally you   to make shojins for your mages.      Comp 2: Magic Banana  Endgame comp:    T3 Raka w/ Mage Hat + Seraph  + Morellos  Brand, Veigar, Vlad, Syndra, Taliyah/Leblanc, Yorick, Aatrox  Similar premise to the voli comp. Soraka is pretty contested due to 9 light comps being rampant, but T2ing her is easy and good enough. In short her ult is insane, with its low mana and incredible impact. Double casting it with morellos will burn the entire map, and force the entire enemy to slap you down with auto attacks. Hydro buff has the same tickrate as her silence,  and so that will basically ensure that she is always ulting every auto or so. Insane tbh.  Once again, prioritize getting mage hat, and then the other two items on her. After than, everything is accessory, but put excess magic/mana items on brand. Give disarm/zeph/zeke to some ranged champ      Comp 3: Shield Stackers  I believe someone posted a  [guide ](  on this yesterday, so I won't detail it too much.  As an appending to their post, this is an A tier comp, but becomes an S tier comp on mountain map because of Qiyana.   Endgame comp:    T3 Ivern, T3 Maokai, T3 Vlad, T3 Leblanc  Taliyah, Diana, Thresh, Earth Qiyana (or Malph).   As personal preference you   to give leblanc, qiyana, or Diana an IE if possible. The damage on this comp just isn't there to get you first place, but it def will get you second place.      Comp 4: Dirty Snowman  Endgame comp:    Olaf w/ BT + Rageblade + Hand/Shiv/Giant Slayer/Rageblade/Runaans  Khazix w/ Frozen Heart, Warmogs   Ezreal, Volibear, Ornn, Braum, Renekton, Zed  In short, olaf is a MONSTER. The craziest part is that a lot of people don't really like the glacial/electric midgame comp, so he is one of the most onpopular 4 * champs. The result? I T3 this bad boy more than 50% of the times I run this comp. Everytime I run this comp I get at least 2 3 * champs and the number of rerolls I do is SUPER low because of gunning for olaf. This comp will likely be at least a little less good once people see its superiority (or equivalence) to the poison version due to a bit more contesting.   The beauty of this comp is you literally don't need anything other than BT and Rageblade to literally come in first place. All your team's job is to just stall until he goes super sayian and its just over.  Electric 3 is insane for damage, but you literally don't need it. Once olaf ults and has at least BT and rageblade, unless he gets redbuffed, its GG. And even if he does, its usually fine because glacial procs run wild.  Another perk of this comp is that it synergizes very nicely with the arenas. While you are waiting for T2 olaf, mountain arena can be used to boost his HP to make him even more evil once you T2 him and get his items.   The Khazix renekton makes the enemy's armor cut in half which is CRITICAL given than this is a low-AD meelee strategy. Zerk synergy is nuts when you have glacial 4. Khazix is incredible with FH because of his mobility and since hes always the last man standing, warmogs is a great choice to help him survive stray bullets.   The trick here is to position Olaf so that he solo kills someone to  t the fight. Use renekton, ornn, and voli as  free food for the enemy so that Olaf can emerge going crazy.   Also as a note, Ez ult applies on-hit, so try giving him a zerker spat item from the last carousel or a runaans if you end up with an extra bow for aoe glacial or other on-hit stuff.", "id": "duizii", "num_comments": 51, "created_utc": 1573426809},

{"title": "The unbeatable sorcs and shrink kaisa comp", "author": "andreikappa", "selftext": "I was getting interest with this comp so I thought I would make a post about it. I don't think I have ever really lost with this comp once it came online, it beats everything. The only things that can counter it is zephyr and maybe a disarm kaisa.   The idea here is that the sorcs kill everything that can be killed easily and then kaisa cleans up the super carries/dragon claws that are left standing. It's a very flexible comp. I have gone into the last stages with random scrappy stuff in my comp and still won. I have tried lots of different versions and anything will work. The only things you need at the core are 3 sorcs (aoe damage), a lvl 1 kaisa with shrink and GA. If GA is not available then dragon claw. For the third item rage blade is preferred but can work with other stuff like shojins, demon ect. Trap claw should go on karthus if you can get it. If for some reason you can't get kaisa then kayle will work as a substitute. I always front line my kindred to the side a bit, it's very strong if it ults.  **Comp versions**  This first version takes a lot of CC. It is strong to everything except assassins. If you are against assassins you will need to front line your sorcs. I go for this version the most often. It transitions from aatrox naturally.     Second version takes full voids. I find this one harder to transition into naturally and I wouldn't say it's worth it unless kaisa is lvl 2 or your chogath is stacked. It is strong though. Make sure you use kassadin to mana burn what you don't   to ult.     Third version takes assassins. Easy to transition into if you go assassins early game. Probably the nastiest version. Assassin performance can vary.     **Other items:**  spell power stuff -  karthus, asol, chogath (if you stack stack chogath enough he will one shot entire teams but if he dies after he ults the void buff won't apply)  yuumis -  pantheon, chogath, sejuani  trap claw -  karthus  extra stuff like giant slayers, silences, GA -  asol (with dragon buff)  warmogs -   pantheon  demon -  karthus, asol, kaisa  seraphs -  karthus, asol  On the late stage carousels put high value on zephyr and trap claw. Trap claw is ridiculously op late game. The more you have the better.  I once stopped a gnar, sej and karthus from ulting because I had kassadin, zephyr and trap claw.  **Early game/mid game**   -nidalee with wild buff (easy to get)   -fiora (if desperate)   -aatrox with sorcs (harder to get but strong, aatrox gets the GA, take morgana, use 6 sorcs if possible, make redemption)   -darius with warmogs, sorcs and katarina for imperial buff (strong)   -assassins (zed gets the stuff)", "id": "dorfwt", "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1572363023},

{"title": "Challenger! From hardstuck to big improvement! Let's go! :)", "author": "Inffes", "selftext": "Hi to all of You,  I would never dream of to post anything like this. However, many post in reddit - guides, tips help me a lot so here is mine. Today just before going to work, I  ted my PC just to check if something happen. It happen.        You probably don't remember but:   1 month ago I was hardstuck -      Then I was hardstuck Diamond for another 2-3 weeks at least.     So, what change and what's really important:  1. First of all, I had cheat sheet with printed 3-4 builds I try to play ever game. I would never try something new/not sure build in ranked game. You wanna try something, invent - cool - go try it few times in normal games. 2. On that cheat sheet I also had table with date/what build I play/place - what give me, is information what was best for me recently. I was writing about my game. I know, you have [blitz.gg]  or something, but having it in front of your eyes is better. Works for me at least. 3. Scouting is important, but If something works for You - play it. Abuse it. 3/5 times it will work so You're still in front with LP. However! If you can transform your build - do it.  4. Right - swapping your build sometimes can give u that sweet spot number 4. Especially, if 4 people going guardian/sorc - often happen right now. 5. Economy is really important, especially right now.  Don't waste money, even having +2 gold can change things. Think about it - +1 roll, when You had 8 lvl and finding that 1 swain to have full imperial synergy. 6. Also now about economy! What I see often, people are also greedy as hell. Specially if they 7 lvl and wait to got 8 lvl. They can afford it but they try to have econ more + they have plenty of hp and don't wanna go in. Probably many of You disagree, but when You're 7-8 lvl round can cost You 20-30hp. Better spend that money even that 40gold to reach to 8lvl put for example 1 knight and have 4 synergy knight. Then You can econ again. I see that they got like 20-30hp and then go in - one bad fight, one RNG, one zephyr on your carry and sheeeshhhh. 7. Remember that most of build can be counter in some way. 8. Items - fist and other are RNG but... Should or You shouldn't build? Depends. Again - many people tends to lose first round to have higher priority in picking items + econ. If you see You have good  t and wanna be sure You get win round build full items or - you can spread some with character that You will eventually sell later. That curve bow on Vayne or fiora early can save You. Srsly. 9. Items from carousel - this topic is really important. If you have bad early game and let assume that You first pick-second pick in second carousel - before golems. Keep your mind open. I mean it. Don't go just for rod/sword because You can have something strong right now. If you spat - take it. Maybe later You can go for 3 sorc early what give You boost. It just beginning of the game. 10. Be patient and practice. More You play, more You write on that cheat sheet more You learn. 11. Enjoy it. 12. Never, NEVER don't give up. It's TFT. Maybe You find 2 spat, maybe neekos help and  You can build 2 *5cost  .   I have channel on Youtube:      If you just press subscribe that would be lovely! If cost You only 1 minute but for me - mean a lot :) Soon I'll try to do some videos.  Also twitch channel:       If you press follow that would be awesome to! Again, no money involved and I keep smiling. There's record what I talk at the beginning - early stream, just to see my challenger achieve lol :)  If You have any question. Wanna discuss something. Post it. I'll glad to help, answer anything.   I'm still learning but it's big and wanna share with You guys. Cheers!", "id": "dj334n", "num_comments": 56, "created_utc": 1571298583}, 
{"title": "How/When to win streak", "author": "GarthbrooksXV", "selftext": "Hello all PleasantVirgin here,     An especially interesting/important choice, especially this patch is whether one should either sit at lvl 3 on 2-1, or take a lvl 4 to play for win streak and tempo.     Consider some pros and cons for each   Do not level 2-1 --    Pros: Potentially more gold income in the early, better chance for a priority item choice of first carousel, higher chance of securing 1 cost 2  red  s.   Cons: likely to lose more hp in the early game, may not reach lvl 2/lvl 3  s as quickly as others     Level to 4 on 2-1 --   Pros: Preserve some hp early, gain the bonus gold from win streak and +1 per battle win, likely to reach lvl 2/3  s upgrades sooner.   Cons: Disaster potential if one tanks their economy too hard to win streak but then loses, more likely to have a hard time upgrading their 1 cost  s     Those pros and cons are pretty much factual. Not sure anyone would argue against them.     Now I have my own advice whether to choose to push a lvl 4 or sit lvl 3 on 2-1:   When to get lvl 4:  You already have at least one 2  red    Lvling makes you strong enough to at least likely beat 6 of 7 players on the board(scout the board),  Lvling gives you a powerspike on synergy such as  [2knights,imperial,ninja ], [2knights, noble ], [3 assassin, imperial ], [3 assassin, void ], [2 void,2 brawler ],.... There are others that are good but these are just some to consider.      IMPORTANT: You do not need a critical item in your build early such as a bf sword or spatula or are willing to gamble you will hit it on a pve battle.     When to hold lvl 3:   You believe that any hp lost early is worth the interest on gold storage and 1 cost  s that you will have longer time to upgrade.  You have a strong enough team to win without lvling.  You need a critical item from carousel to increase your chances of winning.   Leveling does not make you strong enough to beat most players on the board.   You are more concerned with finding specific 1 cost  s and their upgrades than win streaking.     Ok, so that about covers the choice in the most basic sense at least. Leveling 2-1 early often follows a play style throughout the game since one would also hit lvl 5 quicker, but that's a long story and more complicated so I'll leave it as this.  I hope this brief guide is helpful to anyone who has been confused on this decision, and/or those new to the game seeking game knowledge.

{"title": "Nothing more than stubbornness can make you lose", "author": "GarthbrooksXV", "selftext": "Hello Summoners,     PleasantVirgin here, some may recognize me for several somewhat popular guides and notoriously rude comments on this sub and in game. I noticed something about my psychology as a player -- it's not exactly new to this patch -- but especially well expressed.  So after a first moment of introspection in a few months, I figured I might make a guide to collect my thoughts and maybe be helpful to others.      Like many others this patch, I have struggled a bit in ranked. I've  ted to hate the game, care about it less, and play it less. I went from 239 LP Gm about a week ago, to D1 0 LP as of this morning. I can say it's because I'm stubborn. The game changed, but I still haven't. I know what the meta is, but I consciously refuse to embrace the correct style of play.     I ask myself \"why\"? Why is it that I am so opposed to playing what is good? Why did I hate void sins so with a fervor and flame everybody in my games who \"abused\" them in 9.18. Yet, this patch I love forcing random ass sins comps and dropping from top 2 to top 8 in a matter of 4 or 5 rounds in the late game.     I see asol one shot my entire team and I say to myself, \"Well thats some nice horseshit\". Or I kill an entire team except for a pantheon who then proceeds to ult on the 5 or 6 remaining members of my team 3 or 4 more times before I either lose outright or draw an overtime and I say to myself, \"Well, that's some nice horseshit\".     Since I believe so heavily that the meta comps are horseshit and just completely stupid, I refuse to embrace them and play them myself. And I don't mean that I haven't given playing guardians or dragons, or some of the other meta comps a try, but I haven't went and really put myself into the game to the spot where I   to win with something so asinine, so most my attempts at it have been half-ass and make a 3,4,5 spot place when I achieved something close to an S tier comp this patch.     This is the truth -- this patch is all about transitioning something passable in the early-mid game, to something extremely strong in the end game. If you do not have any plans to swap the items off of Lissandra onto Swain, or off of Varus onto Asol, you have chosen to lose. You cannot choose the meta, nor fight it. What's correct is correct. I think this is maybe where a lot of people have lost their LP this patch, because they(me included) have not embraced a full transition to the best comps in the late game.   The reality is that games this patch will mostly end at around 40-45 minutes with pantheons ulting each other to draws in overtime(Or some other S tier comps battling it out. There are actually a decent variety). So if you can't embrace this meta(or any other meta for that matter) because you think it's dumb or wrong or bad game design, you get to lose.      Good players who stay in high elo from patch to patch will cut their pride and adapt continuously to a meta that changes every patch. Those who refuse to do research and adapt, demote.      TL;DR: This is a confession that I approach this game stubbornly based on what I feel is an *ideal* style of play for a strategy game, and it has cost me some rank and more importantly my enjoyment of the game. I haven't adapted my play to the new patch, and I feel like maybe this is a problem many players are facing this patch based on some things I've seen and heard on Twitch and Reddit.", "id": "di0z9e", "num_comments": 51, "created_utc": 1571105091}, 
{"title": "How to rush level 8 and abuse it", "author": "Astordor", "selftext": "Hi guys, first post on reddit, I learned a lot of things here when I  ted the game, so I feel like helping back a little bit. I was diamond 1 three days ago, and at the moment I'm challenger 5  LPs. It took me exactly 18 games to climb, 9 of them were top 1, and I never lost a single LP during the climb. Here is my profile if you wanna check :          So, the final build I used is a really standard one, 4 knights/Guardians/Dragons/3 sorc. In a perfect world, your final comp looks like this :   The idea of the build is to have an unkillable pantheon, and an unkillable aurelion sol. They almost don't take magic damages thanks to the dragon buff, and they also almost don't take physical damages thanks to the guardian and knight buffs.     The important thing to notice is the cost of the comp. Only one 1-cost  , one 3-cost  , three 4-cost  s and 3 5-five cost  s. How is it possible to get so many expensive champs? Well, in the last patch, the droprate of 5-cost  s has been significantly increased at level 8, so it has become really consistent to hit them if you roll enough gold at level 8. That leads us to the main point of this build : the level 8 rush.      Warning : this comp is all about transitions, and you need a good game knowledge to play it consistently. I would recommend to try this in normal game before jumping into ranked games.     The most important thing with this build is the following : do NOT roll before level 8. You   to econ the whole game, hit level 8 about 2 rounds after wolves, and then roll all of your golds to find your 4-cost and 5-cost  s. Don't be afraid too much about your hp, I usually hit level 8 at 30 hp. Who cares if you have 1hp, you won't lose a single fight with the final comp anyway.     Carousel : The best you can get in carousel is probably spatula, because you will need a yuumi or a knight's vow in your final build. However, it is very contested and I don't feel confident in my carousel skills, so I usually grab a rod instead. If you can't get a rod (which is very unlikely, I feel like no one  s it), I'd recommand giant's belt or negatron. I'll talk about the items later.     Early game : really standard, you buy a lot of 1-cost  s to find your 2  s  s. If you are winstreaking, you can push xp to keep the winstreak going, if you are losing, keep your golds. You need to be really open mind here, you just   to play what the game gives you. Even if you don't put them on the board, collect all the knights you see, the 4 knights transition is one of the best in the midgame. When you reach krugs, you   to make sure you can beat them. If you have two 2  s  s, you can stay level 4, if not, push level 5. It never happened to me, but if your comp is still too weak level 5 and you think you won't kill the krugs, then roll a bit. By now, you should be at 50g, and we can enter the midgame.     Mid game : The mid game is the key part of this build, because at this point, you will  t losing fights to everyone unless you highroll. You need to grab every opport y the game gives you to stay alive, and that's why I enjoy this build so much : every game is different. I couldn't list all the transitions I used, but here are a few examples :       - 4 knights with a 4-cost   carry    - Assassins with or without void    - Elementalist    - 4 demons     I also had some games with no synergies at all, just putting in every 2  s  s I had.     Since you are going to lose hp, you will gain carousel priority, so that's the moment when you wanna get that spatula.     Transition and late game : If you followed the steps correctly, you should be level 7 at wolves, still with 50g. If you had a good early game, you probably have 60 hp, if you had a bad one, 40. I usually wait 2 rounds after wolves then push 8 and roll everything, but if you're having a difficult game, you can do it one round earlier. You will have less money to spend, but you obviously don't wanna die at 50g. If you had a really good earlygame, you can wait a bit more, but don't be too greedy. At this point of the game, a loss will most likely make you lose 20hp, so let's avoid that.     During your rolls, you   to keep the same open mind as before, don't focus too much on the comp I posted, you won't exactly reach it instantly. If you don't have pantheon, you can play swain instead, if you dont have Karthus, another sorc will do it, or a Kindred for the phantom buff, if you don't have kayle, play another knight. You find a yasuo/Kai'sa 2  s? Play it until you get your main  s, they will help you a lot. An important thing to keep in mind is that you probably will be the only one at level 8, and no one will have legendary  s, so even if you don't have all your synergies, if you find a 2  s 5-cost  , it will carry.     When you finally complete your comp, there is two options :       - You have 5 hps and you need to win every single fight : roll each turn to upgrade your legendaries.      - You are fine and you can econ again : reach level 9 and add a third guardian (another leona/pantheon or a braum), or build some golds to roll everything again to get that panth on 2  s.     Items : The only items i do consistently are ionic spark and yuumi/knight's vow. Warmog on pantheon is the nuts if you have some belts. For everything else, try to use your items quickly, you'll need them to win the early game. For example, if you can craft an infinity edge in the early game, do it. It doesn't really fit in the final comp, but it will help you so much in early. Same goes for statikk shiv, guardian angel, thieve gloves or any good item in the meta.     I realize I didn't post the knight's vow variation, so here it is :   I think lulu is the best third sorc, but any sorc will do the job.     If you don't get any spat, you   to give up the 4 knights bonus and play something like this :   The second pantheon can also be a second Leona or a braum, the point is to have a third guardian.     If you are up against hextech players, and you have items on kayle/karthus, you can consider positionning like this :       I think I'm finally done with this guide, feel free to ask anything in the comments if you have some questions. Feel also free to give your tips on the build if I forgot some of them.     Good luck tacticians, and may Pantheon be with you !", "id": "dhbcft", "num_comments": 415, "created_utc": 1570977357},

I took about a 2 weeks break then resume climbing the rank. It took me about 2 weeks to climb from Diamond to Master. I dropped back to Plat during  9.19 but got back into Diamond and climbed all the way to Master in 4 days with the advent of patch 9.20. This is what I did to get there.  1) Composition: I used to think that you need to be flexible to climb but found that to not be the case with patch 9.20. I've been forcing the same build every single game and getting top 4 for the majority of them. My core build consists of Aurelion/ Pant/ Leona/ 4 Knights. All of my recent comps have been built around this core. This build is extremely flexible because all you need is 4 knights and carry  s to hold on to items like Morello/Jeweled Gauntlet in the early-mid game until you find your other cores in the late game.   2) Items: I was having trouble in patch 9.19 due to the fact that you need to get a BF sword at all cost because the top comps were Wild sins, Imperial Knight, and Brawler Jinx. You were pretty much going for top 8 unless you manage to get a BF sword. With patch 9.20, I've found that the Dragon/Guardian comp is much less reliance on BF sword since Asol's best items are Morello and Jeweled Gauntlet, imo. I focus on getting those items early game and putting them on someone like Lissandra or even a lvl 2 Garen. It works great on all  s with AOE ultimate.   3) Economy: The game plan here is pretty straight forward. You need to econ to lvl 8 as fast as possible while losing as little life as possible. This is actually kinda difficult now because Riot lessens the amount of XP you need to go to lvl 6 so people can  t hitting you harder and earlier. This can be minimized by getting the good items in the early game and putting it on the right  s. A Lissandra with morello can stall the game for you until you get to lvl 8 to  t rolling for  s. I like to be around 40 gold by the Krug arrives. If you can do this while hovering around 70-75 life, then you're in great shape. Just focus on getting to 50 gold then  t lvling up. You should be at lvl 8 at round 5-1, maybe even earlier.   4)  s: Asol. is your main carry in this build. The most important to get on him is morello and jeweled gauntlet. Morello lets you counter Swain and is generally an OP item. Jeweled Gauntlet is there to let you win vs other Asol. Everyone and their mom has been using Asol. and your Asol. will win out in the end if you have Jeweled Gauntlet. The third item can be w/e that's usually good for Asol. My favorite is actually IE because then Asol. will pretty much guarantee to crit every single time he ults. The other   you put items on is Pantheon. It actually does not even matter what item you put on Pantheon since he is probably the most broken   in the game. As long as there is some tanky item on him, he will always be the last one alive along with your Asol. This is actually very good since you can combine any item that you see fit to help you minimize life loss in the early game.    Those are what I've been doing to help me climb in this meta. I will probably make another post when I get to Challenger. I do stream every day at     if you   to come and check me using this composition. I will probably be trying other comps in the future because I don't think it's a good habit to be forcing the same comp every game.", "id": "dh6cro", "num_comments": 67, "created_utc": 1570943546},

So I put ashe with him to take advantage of him a little bit more and pair ashe with kaisa. Kaisa gets assassin buff, ranger buff, and void buff in this comp. So she is the priority for item stacking. Some items that are good on her are ie, giant slayer, and swordbreaker.      You have to play some transition to get to this obviously.      I got one more. This one is slight high roll, but honestly 5 cost are so easy to get this patch. As in, 6 noble is easy to get.    This one is actually good no troll. Lucian and fiora both got a buff, kayle is far easier to find. Cho is a really nice   to put with the nobles cuz they really lack a good cc and morello applier on their own.    So I suggest to put morello, redemption on cho for this one, kayle or lucian can have an item if it fits, like for some reason u got a random ass ludens or shojin then go ahead and give them.    But again you wanna stack the kaisa with ie, rageblade, giant slayer, hurricane, swordbreaker, etc...     The reason she is really good with the nobles is that she gets mr and armor scale onto her shielding so shes very tanky in this comp and is able to ult over and over and over like is ideal for her.      Also, there's a variation you can sub pantheon for cho or add panth at 9. If you have warmogs, thornmail, fh available then he is unkillable and its kind of funny to watch.

{"title": "Intrepreting 9.20/ Soft tier list", "author": "GarthbrooksXV", "selftext": "PleasantVirgin here, peak around 250 lp gm this patch. After reading the patch notes I'd like to give my take on them and how it affects the meta.      When Riot has a hard time balancing something they tend to nerf it to nothing while they think about a better way to deal with it. This is Frozen Heart this patch. This is the biggest nerf to assassins in the patch. The cc from them stacking champs with FH then flying over your team, then flipping around everywhere after that was just so oppressive that it made it to where your champs had no chance to do anything before being one shot.      Assassins aren't dead with these changes, however. Double ie akali/zed are still going to one shot. They're just going to be a little less consistent, and tanks will be able to buy a little more time for carries. There were 5 or 6 nerfs to wild assassins in the notes, but I don't think it takes them away from still being a high tier comp due to this: they still get to include gnar in the comp(best champ in the game), they still can toss in hextech(most oppressive synergy in the game), and they still have very high damage(akali/zed critting for  ~25  instead of  ~3 0 is a bit irrelevant when most champs have about 12  as two  ).     Imperial knights were probably the most consistent top 4 option last patch, and this patch they will be easier to get for the players lvling sooner. Draven Yasuo and Swain 2 are going to be much easier to land, so I expect this to be the most sought after combination this patch. Yasuo swain and draven are all very strong against assassins with 2   and the right items. People may even find this comp frustratingly oppressive this patch.      Rangers may find their way in, with a late game sub kaisa for vayne looking interesting to give them a much needed power spike where they typically fall off due to other top 4 comps often having a gnar available to dislodge them from a safe position. I think they move from a D tier(completely unplayable gm+) to B tier(situationally viable) this patch.     Brawlers/jinx knights/jinx is indirectly stronger than last patch due to being hit with no impactful nerfs, while most other comps were.     I won't comment on other comps, just to keep this brief enough, but I think it's pretty fair to say we should see a little more variety this patch.     As far as popular comps go, I rate like this for 9.20(very tentative since we haven't played the patch yet):     S : Imperial knight, Brawlers Jinx, Brand carry ele sorc(this was actually sleeper op comp not many people picked up on last patch and anivia 2 is going to be available).   A: Wild Assassin, 6 knight+any carry(shy/asol, karthus, brand, etc...), 6 SS/3 yordle, SS ele, SS reroll   B: Void reroll, Rangers, Knight reroll   C: Nobles+carry, 6 yordle, gunslinger   I'm not posting this to self-promote, nor do I purport to be one of the premier experts in the game. I hope this run-down is helpful to people thinking about what they may play next patch and sparks some discussion on the meta.

{"title": "Forcing ninja elementalists properly! (Challenger guide)", "author": "threshhookme", "selftext": "Hi guys, I would like to share my method of achieving rank #51 NA challenger (740 lp at the time of this post) by a comp that I force 90% of the time in this meta. This ninja assassin elementalist comp existed all the way back to patch 9.13, but in this current state of the meta it is surprisingly uncontested as most people prefer the wild assassin as their go-to comp. Today I would like to reinforce this easy-to-force comp as a viable strategy to climb the ladder in all elos, as well as to show an optimal way to use this comp effectively.   **First carousel:**  Priority on the first carousel should be brawler's gloves/bf sword, since it is a heavily contested item for infinity edge. Spatula can also be taken, in which you will put it on kennen to make her an assassin as an effective way to cc the backline where carries most often are positioned.  **Itemization:**  In most of the games where I force ninja elementalists I focus on putting these items on the following  s, with the most important items going to Akali and Kennen:  Infinity Edge x2/Gunblade OR Infinity Edge/Jeweled Gauntlet/Gunblade - Akali or Zed if 3  red (BT gunblade for zed)  This is where you put IE on your main carry, as crit damage is extremely strong in this meta to one/two-shot carries. Gunblade is used to offset the ionic spark commonly used in jinx/blitz brawler comps. Replacements for gunblade if you are unable to get a BF sword would be dragon's claw against a lobby with mostly sorc comps/ionic sparks or guardian angel if there are multiple jinx brawler/draven/hyperroll knight carry comps. Also, zed is barely contested right now because of multiple wild assassin people replacing him for Akali so Zed is relatively easy to 3 *, making him another carry on your team.   Locket/Redemption/Yoummu's - Kennen  With locket being 3  HP which lasts 7 seconds, this surprisingly has not been used enough in this meta. I would even consider this item to be core, since your assassins need to last long enough to be able to kill the enemy carries or survive the entire fight. As well, the bonus AP and armor is beneficial to make Kennen's ult do a bit more damage as well as to be a bit more tanky. Redemption on Kennen can be made so that his ult goes off faster as well as to heal, giving assassins/tanks a bit more time in the fight. And finally, Yoummu's is the item that improves my result from top 3/4 to top 2, as being able to cc and eliminating the backline faster provides better reliability for this comp to win rounds, while a non-yoummu Kennen would have the chance to ult only a couple tanky targets given proper enemy positioning.  Other items that are strong in this comp:  Thief's gloves is a very powerful item that gives 20% crit and 2 random full items for the price of one. If you obtain 2 brawler's gloves then I suggest putting this on a 3rd carry, zed, for extra damage.  Zephyr is quite an effective tool late game, especially when you aim to keep their Akali or Rengar out of the fight or take out a crucial tank temporarily which was protecting their jinx/draven carries. I would avoid building this early game due to all 8 people being alive so its difficult to maximize its use.  Ionic spark is an underrated item in assassin comps, since its possible that the enemy will cast multiple spells, making them squishier and easier for our assassins to kill as a result. If you somehow obtain negatron+rod from creep rounds and believe you have enough damage/sustainability for your comp, consider building this item.  Frozen heart is also good but I rarely use it due to locket giving enough survivability as well as prioritizing Evelynn over pyke for the demon trait bonus as well as Evelynn not needing items to work well in this comp. If you end up rolling Pyke instead of Evelynn however, FH can be used on him.  **Play-by-play comp transition example: (this game was played with keane and aceofspadesdac) ***  Stage 2-1:     Krugs:     Stage 3-1:      Stage 3-4 (after carousel):      Stage 4-1:      Stage 4-4 (after carousel):      Stage 5-1 (zephyr placed on zed - also leveled to 8 here):      Stage 5-4 (at 5-2 lvl 3 zed was obtained):      Stage 6-4 (level 2 akali + leveled to 9):      End result/opponents comps:     ** ***As you can see econ management through all stages of the game is a key factor towards the success of this comp. In the early game I often play depending on what  s I get (i.e. 2 knights, 2 brawler, 2 demons, etc. and level of  s). If I was **not** win streaking then I would have econed to 30-40 gold by krugs (not leveling to 5), getting priority on first/second pick on carousel for BF sword/brawler's gloves. Of course the pace and aggression of every lobby is different so keep that in mind when determining your interest goal.    * *At round 4-1 this was the decision whether I would go wild assassin if I fail to find akali and manage to find ahri 2 */nidalee 2 * (selling kennen and shen) or ninja assassin (if I get akali while rolling down, then proceeding to sell gnar and rengar). Remember that having 2 possible pathways to different comps is a way to not get screwed when forcing a comp. Soft forcing requires practice to do it properly without screwing your economy but pays off with much better results in all elos compared to hard forcing a single comp where you risk not getting the key  s and potentially getting 7th/8th.       **How the comp looks at mid/late game:**  Level 7 comp  (completed, most important):       For level 8, you can add an extra lvl 2 zed or lvl 1/2 akali. Pyke with frozen heart is also a viable option.   For level 9 or level 8 + FON,  you can make 6 assassins (pyke then rengar or kaisa), or you can choose to add an extra glacial like anivia, braum, or sejuani for sustainability, or add rengar + gnar combo etc. depending on enemy comps but make sure akali is 2  red and often, **if uncontested**, zed is 3  red before leveling to 9.       Alright so I'm quite sure that this is all I have for this guide.

{"title": "My little guide/tips on getting to Plat (involves a little of each strategy and easy to follow)", "author": "Jesric1029", "selftext": "Hello everyone!   I recently got to Plat and have fully developed my strategy. While I was in gold I spent a lot of time experimenting with different strategies (strict econ from beginning, power leveling to 8, hyper rolling, etc) but I finally believe that I found a strategy that sort of uses all of those methods and I've been doing quite well since. I hope maybe this guide can help some people out who   to try something a little different and more.. specific..      So first things first with this strategy. The most important thing of all - **do not have your mind set on one comp before the game even  ts**. We all have that comp we enjoy or gravitate to and that's fine, but have an open mind in your first couple of picks.       I am also going to separate these steps based more on rounds and general \"stages\" of the game instead of going strictly by your level.       ***Minion Wave + First 3 PVP Rounds***  During the early rounds I have a couple of objectives/priorities that I look at in this order. This is the priority (in my opinion) that I go with, strategy wise (ignoring the obvious, get champs I need).   1. **Determine my comp**  - When I begin a match I don't know what team comp I will play. Usually once I have a level 2 champ I will take a look and that will drive my strategy. So if I get a level 2 Vayne and I have a Garen on the side I might look at Noble or Ranger for example. Keep in mind this applies mostly to those key champs and getting 3 Camilles for example may not be enough for me to decide my comp.  2. **Level up**  - I personally feel like there is a lot of value in leveling up early. I feel like it's a solid investment of your gold as opposed to re-rolling which is more of a gamble. Reaching level 6-8 first means that you will have better chances of getting those T4 and T5 champs. The way that I handle leveling up until I reach 6 is pretty simple - if I have enough gold to level up I do so. I do not spend any gold on XP unless I have enough to level up however. Will get into this more in the next stage.  3. **Scout other players**  - Really it's a good idea during those 3 pvp rounds to get an idea of what your opponents are building, especially since the rounds are a bit slow. Assuming you see 3 other players building the same noble comp you may   to switch it up and do something like knight/rangers.  4. **Re-roll**  - I put this last for a reason. I am not a fan, at all, of hyper-rolling. I understand for some players it's a good strategy and works for them but personally I find it's a huge gamble. I don't enjoy blowing 10 gold for nothing when I have bad luck and I feel like the gold is way better spent just saving for interest and leveling up. The exception to this is when you get a lot of bonus gold from the minion waves. In this case I might re-roll a couple of times since I have that bit of extra gold, especially if I had bad luck with my champs.   ** * *Bonus Tip**  - Don't put your items on your champs at this stage unless you are certain that champ will be a \"carry\". While this may give you a short term boost late game the item could do far more on a better champ. A good example could be putting RFC on Varus when you could really save it for Kai'Sa (with a ranger comp). The only time I feel you should put an item on a champ who might not really be best with it is when you are losing frequently and are getting desperate.      ***Post carousal, till level 6***    Coming out of the carousal round you should know what team comp you are going to do. You should have scouted your opponents and hopefully have at least one or two level 2 champs. Priorities are as follows:   1. **Level up**  - Personally I continue to level up until I hit 6. As stated before, I don't buy XP unless I have enough gold to actually level up. Once I hit level 6 I may or may not continue to power level - will get to that in the next section. Pretty much any team comp though I'm going to put leveling up above saving my gold or re-rolling.  2. **Re-roll**  - Sometimes things really don't go your way. Maybe you find your team is full of level 1 champs or you are losing every single round and taking a large amount of damage. This usually doesn't happen to me because I've spent my gold on leveling up so even if I'm lacking level 2 champs I'll have more on the board than most of my opponents so even if I lose rounds I don't take much damage. Try to avoid re-rolling till 6 if you can but if things seem that bad it's a valid option. (although not if you can see the reason you aren't getting champs you need is because opponents have them).  3. **Re-evaluate**  - This is sort of the point where your team comp is defined but it's not too late to change. Remember, you can still get your gold for selling a champion and you certainly aren't \"locked in\" at all. Maybe you are noticing a massive amount of void champs every round appearing in your pick but not getting lucky with the comp your working on, switching comps and selling/buying is a valid option in some situations.  4. **Item Analysis**  - Always going for bow -  large rod -  BF isn't the best approach in many situations at this point. Try to look at your key champs and think about what champs you might get in the future and plan your shopping list accordingly especially if your in the bottom 4 (since you get first pick of items).      ***Post level 6, above 50% HP***  Once you hit level 6 it's time to make some decisions about the direction you   to take with your strategy. The important thing will be to ask yourself a few questions and then look at the answers to all these questions together:   * **Am I in the lead?** Assuming you are on a good win-streak and know some champions you need are in the rotation it might be good to take a more aggressive approach with re-rolling ---- When your behind I feel the best decision is to just save your money. Yes it's hard to not re-roll when your losing rounds but it will pay off when you have a larger pool of gold to work with later. Of course this only apples to 50% HP and higher.  * **Do I need T5 champions in my build?** Needing T5 champions means that you will probably   to level up to 7 as soon as possible. I still won't buy XP until I have enough to level up but in this situation I won't spend my gold on re-rolls.  * **Am I playing gunslinger?** Playing gunslinger is quite a bit weaker than it was in the past and as such I suggest trying to work in pirate in the earlier rounds so that you get that extra income. You can use that for 1 extra re-roll per turn because it's very important you get the champs you need if you   to have a chance as gunslinger/blademaster to place in 1st or 2nd.       **Post level 6, below 50% HP**  Once you fall below 50% HP, assuming that at least 4 players remain in the game it's probably time to  t spending that gold. If you have followed this guide I imagine you would have a nice stash at this point and would probably be level 7 or 8. You need to decide what to spend your gold on   these are the points I look at:   1. **Should I re-roll?** Do I know that there are probably champions in the rotation that I will get by rolling. Especially those T4 or T5 champs that I need? 2. **How much should I roll?** Keep in mind that there is no magic place where you should spend every dime you have. The reason that I say 50% HP is so that you have some breathing room. Spend some gold and if you get two or three champions upgraded hold off on spending more till you see how you fare in the next round.  3. **Should I level up?** Do I have some champion on standby that will give me an additional tribe or class bonus?   Those questions will generally tell me what to spend my gold on. I will only spend enough as I feel is required to give myself a better chance in the next battle.   **Post level 6, below 30% HP**  At this point it's getting too risky to play the economy game. You risk losing or even being 1-shot and should spend the gold you have saved up. Unless you get so lucky that you feel you won't lose any more rounds I suggest that you spend all available gold on re-rolls or level up to give you the best opport y possible to place higher.       **Post level 6, above 50 gold**   Assuming you have over 50 gold great job on managing your economy well. This stage should feel pretty good, especially if you are on a win-streak. I usually mix-up my spending and might buy a little XP and a re-roll or two per round. Do not spend below your 50 gold however as you   to keep that bonus. There are a couple exceptions to that rule.   * **Keep an eye on those low-health opponents with champions that you need**. Once they are eliminated from the match you might consider spending between 10-30 gold to pick up those champs you need. Try not to get carried away with rolling though - once you fall back to 0 gold late game it's very difficult to build yourself back up! The difference between 1st and 2nd place can often come down to who managed to hold onto their gold well. This is really the only case where I will go below 50 gold when I have more than 50% HP. * Obviously if you say, re-roll with 52 gold and a champ you need appears you can spend gold even if it puts you below 50, this is a general principal but not concrete.  * Once it's down to the last 2 or 3 players you can  t spending money as necessary. If your well in the lead of 1st place though and can see that 3rd place has a lot of champions you need you might   to save a little bit.       **Suggested Items (my preference)**   These are my favorite items to get in the current meta. I am not going to say that these are the best items just that they are items I greatly prefer   1. **Thief's Gloves** : I really love these things. They are such a fun item that really make the game fresh and it's sort of exciting to see what your champ will get. If you are power-leveling to 6 or 7 like my guide suggests you will get pretty good items on a champ with this item. Essentially it's like getting 2 and 1/2 items on a champ with only 1 item. I don't suggest putting this on your carry but it's my favorite item on some other strong champs.  2. **Rage-blade.** 3. **Giant slayer**  - Great for dealing with pesky tanks especially a shape-shifter opponent.  4. **Deathcap**  - Now that it's clear how deathcap works, it's a good item on a lot of champs. Even on a champion like Vayne I have seen a deathcap take the % of maximum health she does as true damage from 14% to 21%. 5. **Morell**  - Good if your opponent has a ton of healing champions.   Anyway those are my favorite items that are general in almost any comp, this doesn't include obvious items like FoN or comp specific items like BoRK          **Example match**  Here is a good example match. I did not have the greatest  t in this match. I did have a level 2 Vayne going into the carousal but didn't have too much else going on. I put some items on Vayne to keep myself from losing too much health and treated her as a carry in the early/mid game. I was doing okay winning/losing about equally and I just got to level 6 then strictly saved my money. Even at the end of the game when there were only 3 players left I still had 50 gold. This allowed me to really snow-ball extremely well as you can see and I easily won 1st place. My point is that in the late game you will take far more damage than you will in the early game. It's okay to lose a few rounds in the beginning if your doing a good job saving your money and building up that nest egg.

I've managed to come top4 with it pretty consistently too, I think averaging around 2nd place right now, and you can force it due to the versatile nature of it.  The idea is centred around the fact that Iceborn Gauntlet applies a 30% attack speed debuff when the champion it's equipped on dodges. As you can tell already, that means it's super strong on yordles, who have a 30% dodge chance with only 3 on the board. Add a phantom dancer and a frozen heart and you're really  ting to stack the chance of slowing attack speed. Here's the thing, the attack speed slows stack, so the more you can get off, the better. The other great thing about sparring gloves, is that they increase dodge chance as well, so with yordle buff, + PD + one sparring gloves item, you're looking at, at least, 50% dodge chance.  Now you might be wondering why you're not just going for 6 yordle, that's because Wild is the only counter to this strategy. So we're going to build 4 wild instead. In addition, due to the fact that 2 wild champs are shapeshifters, we'll throw a shyvana in there for the shapeshifter synergy, and finally, because shyv is a dragon, you can combine her with asol, and since you've already got ahri for wild, it makes sense for lulu to be your third sorc, since she's already a yordle. If you get super lucky, and you can build two mittens, I'd highly recommend going 6 yordle with 2 iceborn gauntlet, this build does require 4 sparring gloves, though, so make sure you've always got at least one mittens and two iceborns before committing to another set of mittens.  So, without further ado, let's jump into the build.  Item preferences, in priority order  * Spatula * Sparring Gloves * Chain Vest * Recurve Bow * Tear  You're going to   to combine items in this priority order:  * Sparring Gloves + Spatula, mittens, you can put this on your non-yordle champs to get that sweet yordle buff early. You'll   to put this on placeholder  s only, I'll specify which  s should placehold later. * Sparring Gloves + Chain Vest, creates an iceborn gauntlet, this is the core of your build, you   this item on MINIMUM two champions. This works best when stacked. I usually put this on gnar eventually, so if you can build it early on, put it on a placeholder   but not anyone that you   to actually keep in your comp. * Recurve Bow + Chain Vest, Phantom Dancer, this adds 25% dodge chance, higher if the enemy is building crit items. * Chain Vest + Tear, frozen heart, this is just to add insult to injury, really. You don't absolutely need this item but it adds some serious weight to the slow, not to mention, it's permanent, so it backs up your RNG slows with a solid backbone.  You'll   the same items throughout the game, this is all you're likely to build.  Champs:  * (Placeholder) Kassadin * (Placeholder) Jayce * (Placeholder) Tristana * (Placeholder) Warwick * Nidalee * Ahri * Lulu * Veigar * Rengar * Poppy * Gnar * Shyvana * Asol * Swain  (IMO, Shyv and Swain are interchangable, you're going to stack both of them, Shyv is easier to build, but if you're having trouble and you find a Swain, take him instead. Alternatively, if you've picked up a Darkin or you've got the spare items to make one, throw that on gnar and get demon with gnar/swain. If you're planning on going Asol, definitely pick up Shyv over Swain. 90% of the time, you   shyv, there are very few scenarios you'll be playing Swain.)  In the early game, you just   to collect yordles, wild and sorc. These are your core elements, you'll be able to add shapeshifter later on once you get to a point where you can buy shyvana.  Later on, you   to  t switching out your placeholder  s for the core  s, the ones that are actually important.  In terms of managing econ, I find it's best to judge based on the strength of the lobby. I try to spend at the  t of rounds, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1, 4-2, etc, I'll try to econ for the rest. I don't mind losing a lot early for two reasons, I can get higher priority pick on the carousel, and I lose way less health early. I've lost all the way to round 3-4 before and still had 60hp. It's definitely a lot easier to econ a bit earlier on, especially since a lot of your  s are mid-game to late-game  s. Later on in the game, you'll have a better idea of how strong everyone else is, if you see someone levelling up or upgrading  s, it might be time to roll/level until you feel strong enough.  I know this isn't too in depth, so if you've got any questions just shoot and I'll try to answer them for you. The reason this comp works is that it provides huge amounts of CC, tankiness and DPS (sorcs are huge for damage, especially if you get given a lot of magic damage items) Not only that, but it combines a comp with it's own counter, so everyone else attempting to build wild is going to struggle a little more, and with shapeshifter popularity right now, you're competing for some pretty highly contested champs. The beauty of this is, that those champs can be 1 * and still carry if they're itemised correctly.  I might come back later and update this with a general round-by-round set of rules you should be following, which should help you to follow this a lot easier, if there's a demand for it.  glhf!", "id": "d9q8ce", "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1569533202}, 
{"title": "9.19 GM/CHALLENGER Rangers guide", "author": "Traussio", "selftext": "Hello, fellow tacticians, I come here to show you a build i've been using in challenger this patch, it's a pretty consistent comp that can contest for first place if played well. It's not a new build, it's your basic korean ranger composition but integrating Kai'sa in the late game. In this guide i'll explain what I do in every stage of the game and hopefully it will help people climb in this exciting new patch.  **Items:**  The great thing about this composition is it can use a lot of different items, so even if you are first place, you should be able to get something useful. Try to get the following items  Tear of the goddess: This is a very important item for your mid game, you use it to create 1 of 3 items for your Lucian, Stattik Shiv (mana + bow) Hand of Justice (mana + glove) or Ludens (mana + rod). 1 tear is incredible, more than that i would not recommend.  Recurve bow: If you already have a tear, try to get a lot of bows, they're insane, You use them to create Guinsoo's rageblade (bow + rod)  Negatron cloak. A great all around item, you use it for runaan's hurricane (Cloak + spatula), dragon's claw (2 Cloak) Ionic spark (Cloak + rod)  Sparring glove: You   these to make a thief's glove (double glove) for your Aatrox, he'll slap people with that. Also 1 is needed if you go Hand of Justice lucian.  Guardian angel is a great item for any comp, and a great way to spend your chain vests.  Morellos and red buff are pretty nice.  **Economy:**  This is a pretty standard economy plan. If you're diamond+ then you can do whatever you  , you probably already know a lot about economy. If not, then stick to this plan, it's very consistent and should be enough to help you in the lower ranks.  The early game for this composition is actually pretty strong, I like trying to winstreak and spend my money aggresively until Krugs, this means i'll level up for the first pvp round (stage 2-1, 4 gold) and before the first caroussel (stage 2-3, 8 gold).  After Krugs, you level up to 6 (12 gold) and roll a little bit if you need upgrades. After that, you save your money until wolves and level up to 6 after you kill them (stage 4-1), roll again if you need upgrades.  At this point you need to ask yourself if you can get first place, if the answer is no, you spend your money aggressively and try to get top 4. If you're comfortable with your comp and hp, save money to level up to 8 after raptors.  DON'T GO TO 9 UNLESS YOU'RE SLAPPING EVERYBODY.  ** s:**  In the beginning you   to be looking for your key early game champions, which are nobles, knights and rangers. The most important champion is Lucian, he will be your main carry during the mid game. Your ideal composition entering Krugs should be something like 2 knights with 3 nobles and 2 rangers. If you find 4 knights, you put them in, it's a very strong synergy for early/mid game. I like keeping the nobles when I enter the mid game even if I don't play them, you can easily pivot into 6 nobles if you find leona/kayle early-ish.  Example composition entering Krugs:    I like adding Braum at lvl 6, but it's not necessary  Entering the mid game you should be level 6. best case scenario you have lucian 2 with one of the 3 items I mentioned above, he will absolutely body fools. You also give him any item you would give ashe (guinsoos/runaan's most of the time)  During this stage you   to find Aatrox, Sejuani and kindred. If you have GA/morello, give it to Sej. Thief's gloves to Aatrox. If you already have enough items on your lucian, stack the vayne, we will replace her for Kai'sa in the late game.  If you find all your rangers with ashe 2, sell your Lucian, put in Ashe and give her Lucian's items  Example comp at lvl 7 (wolves):  with ashe 2:    without ashe 2   (can add ashe or vayne instead of braum)  Entering the late game, your composition remains pretty much the same, but we replace Vayne with Kai'sa and add Cho'gath on 8. 2 void is actually pretty good, and because you have 2 very strong void  , it doesn't matter who gets the buff. Doing this gives you a very strong frontline with a lot of champs to sacrifice to assassins/blitz. Positioning is everything with rangers, and this should give you a lot zone control to work with.  Your end game team:     _ _ _ _ _ _ _  Thanks to everyone for creating and being part of such a great comm y, this subreddit has been a lot of help for me, specially when new patches arrive, so I  ed to keep it going and maybe help someone.  Keep in mind, this is probably not the best ranger composition out there, but it's what i've been using lately in Challenger elo, and I think it has great potential.

{"title": "Sushin's Guide to Transition  s", "author": "SushinTTV", "selftext": "Hi guys, it took me a while but I finally hit 2x Challenger!  With another  goal accomplished, that means it's time for me to write another guide.  This one will be on transition  s.  **What are transition  s?**  Transition   s are temporary  s that you can put in during the early-mid game  to better utilize your items until you can finish building your final  comp.  For example, 1 *Ashe is pretty weak in the early game.  She only  really  ts to shine when she's 2 * and you have both Ranger and  Glacial synergy active, and when that requires you to put in a 1 *(or  even 2 *)Vayne and a 1 * lissandra, there's probably a better option  available.  **Transition  s vs Econ**  There's  always a looming question over whether the transition  s are worth  the loss in interest, since you need to have those  s on the field  while also keeping your final comp  s on the bench.  The math is  pretty simple.  Transition  s typically cost 6 gold or less(one 2 *  2-cost  , or two 2 * 1-cost  s), so typically it's going to cost you 1 interest every other round.  You also earn 1 gold every time you  win.  This means that if the transition  s are strong enough to win  you every other round that you otherwise wouldn't, you come out with the  same amount of gold and you'll have way more life.  This means it's  almost always worth looking at transition  s if your comp has a weak  early-mid game.  Aside from that, it gives you the option to roll later because you have the time.  You  don't have to feel obligated to roll a little after Krugs because you're  too weak, which will give you a much stronger economy in a lot of your  games.  The only exception is when  you're hard-econ losestreaking.  Besides the obvious of  ing to  losestreak, very often you'll barely hit the next interest bracket every  round with something like 22 gold- 30 gold- 40 gold- 51 gold,  so holding onto transition  s can lose you gold every single turn.   Currently, the only comp that  s to actively try to do this is  Voidsin, although if you get a pile of gold in the first 3 rounds any comp can do it.  **List of Transition  s**  Without further ado, this is my list of  s to use for each strong early-game item in order from strongest to weakest.  ***1-cost  s are assumed to be 2 *, while 2/3-cost  s are assumed to be 1 *.***   2 * 2-cost  s in this list will pretty much outperform any 1-cost   , so go ahead and put those items on 2 *Zed if you got lucky.  *Stattik Shiv*  - Nidalee(wild buff required), Zed, Lucian, Fiora, Shen  *Guinsoo's Rageblade*  -  Lulu(decent frontline required), Zed, Nidalee(wild buff required), Evelynn(Demon2+decent frontline required), Lucian, Shen  *Guardian Angel*  - Garen, Kennen, Redemption combo with any frontline  *Redemption*  - Darius, Guardian Angel combo with any frontline  *Morellonomicon*  - Kennen, Garen, Lissandra  *Rapidfire Cannon*  - Nidalee(wild buff required), Zed, Graves  *Red Buff*  - Lucian, Graves, Zed, Gangplank  *Luden's Echo*  - TF, Lissandra, Lucian  **Additional notes:**  Zed  stays good in any comp until your frontline  ts to melt, and then  the enemy just turns on Zed and kills him instantly.  Usually happens  some time after Krugs.  2 *Nidalee  with shiv is so good early that it's worth running a 1 *Warwick with it  for a while, but without the wild buff she is total garbage.  Darius is so good with Redemption that he can be used as a 1 * for a while.  Rageblade/Shiv becomes exponentially better if you're lucky enough to get both.  RFC Red Buff Graves is nuts.  Evelynn Rageblade is probably the less common one in the list, but it works.  The other items are either not something to build early, or the best  s to use them early are the ones that make it in the final comp anyways  (such as Warmog's on Shyvana).  I'm sure I missed some.  If you have some other early game carry options you'd like to share, I would love to know!   * * * *  **Thanks for reading!**  If you have any more questions or just   to hang out, feel free to drop by my [Stream]    I also do free VOD coaching every Friday for anyone above Silver rank  from 6PM-2AM PST, all you need to do is show up with a video recording  available.", "id": "d6p9bt", "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": 1568951149}, 
{"title": "I have found a way to make void sins better... I am so sorry.", "author": "awesomeclark1", "selftext": "Basically I have done this twice now and I think it is completely busted.      With new the wild changes allowing you not to build RFC for assassins it is completely busted. Let me explain.  Your wild  s should be Warwick, Nidalee, Rengar, and either Ahri or Gnar, this depends on which Five cost   you   to get late game, I have never made it that far but if you hit level 8 this is important. Your void  s should be Kassadin, Kha'Zix, and either Reksai or Cho.  So we know with void sins you basically need to stack the Kassadin with Assassin Spatula and RFC and IE. But in this comp I like to stack the Rengar first because it is more reliable to get items for Rengar rather than Kassadin because of the Spatula, so items like BT and IE and GA are brilliant. But with the Kassadin and the wild bonus you don't need to build RFC so this frees up a slot for an additional slot either GA or Claw or any item. I pref going GA but it is up to you. With this comp you are not going to get 6 Assassin bonus so IE is pretty much essential but the lack of need for RFC is well worth it in my opinion. This is a level 7 comp with Void 3 Assassins, Brawlers, and Wild bonus. Now for your five     depends on your last wild  . If you went Ahri you can get a Karthus for sorcerer bonus and if you went gnar you can get swain for shapeshifter bonus.

{"title": "Recently hit Challenger and now Rank 3 - 257 LP on SG/Garena. Will  t streaming + free coachng etc.", "author": "pandalace123", "selftext": "Hey guys!  First off, let me just say that the Singapore server is very underpopulated and in terms of skill and competitiveness at the highest level is definitely not as good as the EUW/NA/KR servers. If I were to play on those servers I would probably hit be only masters at most. However although our server is not as skilled we have a lot of players that adapt comps from chinese players from chinese servers and watching chinese streamers such as the void assassin comp that first appeared there.  I  ted playing this game 2 months ago and finally hit challenger last week. I hit challenger a few days ago and the climb to rank 3 was pretty easy as there are only 34 players in challenger. I hit challenger around 180 games and played another 10 - 20 games and reach rank 3 around with around 2  games. This is obviously not impressive as others have done better.   I have recently also created a smurf and hit diamond in around 50 games.  Here is how I play and some tips, mind you the way we play in SG might be very different from how you guys play in your regions, also this is my playstyle which I have found most successful and the most important tips I have found to help me, which might not be for you.  1. **Econ and put weak  s until krugs+lose early and have early carousel priority for items:** I primarily played only dragon/shapes/knight comps or ranger/elemental comps. Those  s are expensive and you   to save as much gold as possible. I ONLY buy knights/tanky  s I see early and early pirates. I sell  s to hit the next interest gold to make extra income. I try to hit 10 gold by 2-1 sometimes I hit 20 gold by 2-1 after the creep around if I get a gold  t from creeps. If I get pirates I put two in the back at opposite corners and the third one in the center. If I don't get pirates I put two knights at opposite ends at the back and one ranged   in the center front. This is the easiest way to \"int\" that I have found and watched from others. Since you are losing early you will have early carousel priority to build items that you need. For my comps like rangers and dragons I usually go for rods and bows. If you can deny a spatula from the void assassin player that is good too as you can use a spatula for many ranger comps. I do not reroll until krugs or at 3-1. I go on a lose streak until krugs and by then if I inted properly I would have 40-50 gold, if you had a pirate buff you probably have 60 gold. At krugs I decide if I need to level to 5 to beat the camp, you don't   to lose the possible item/gold drops. If you don't level to 5 and stay at 4 make sure you have at least 2 2 * s like knights to beat the camp. At 3-1 I level to 6 no matter if I am level 5 or 4. After you level to 6 at 3-1 look at your items while you reroll and decide one of the meta comps that you can go. 2. **Decide your comp after krugs or have an idea by at 3-3**: After krugs is when you lose a ton of health if you don't stabilize correctly. As mentioned previously at level 6 at 3-1 I   to reroll down to 10 gold from the 40- 50 gold and I usuallyd decide which comp I'm going by Krugs based on the items I have. GA/Guinsoo = Shapeshifter/Dragon comp. Rageblade/Hurricane/stattik on hit items = Ranger comp. You   to look for those core  s at 3-1, 3-2. If you have to reroll at 3-3 to stabilize and not lose too much health do it, even if you lose as long as you kill some of their  s and not fall below 40-30 health by wolves you should be alright. I don't reroll after the carousel as I   to save gold and income to hit lvl 7 after wolves for my comp to come online. 3. **Focus on a strong lvl 7 comp not a lvl 8/9 comp which you might never get to-** After wolves is when everyone goes to level 7 usually and that's when you   to put a strong comp and decide if you can fight for top 1 or top 4. If I know I can't fight for top 1 I usually stay at level 7 to reroll and got all my 4 cost  s to 2 *. If you were strong during stage 3 and on a win streak and after wolves you hit good  s too when rerolling you can  t to econ and save gold for lvl 8 for adding the extra buff/traits to your already strong comp. 4. **Force comps/play comps you are familiar with** : This is a very simple tip, but forcing a comp gets you into the habit of knowing how to play it, it's powerspikes, positioning, items etc. Moreover if you play comps like rangers which I think is essential in your arsenal, you can play many different variations like rangers with elementals or knights or guardians or yordles (kennen/gnar/poppy).  I am also thankful and grateful for this subreddit as I was stuck in diamond 1-2 for a while until I came across several guides like the yordle/sorc/shape/dragon comp which helped me a lot. I also   to give back to the comm y and subreddit, therefore I will be be  ting my first stream tomorrow and will explain my thought processes in game and how I transition through the early-mid-late game. I recently moved to Moscow from Singapore as I am studying Psychology in Moscow State University next month, so I will be playing on the Russian server as that probably gives me the best ping with an unranked account and climb to see far I can go. Might also consider playing on EUW if the ping isn't too bad eventually as it seems more competitive in the high elo ladder. I will also be happy to answer any questions on my stream and will be offering free coaching for the time being (you can pm me on twitch or here).

{"title": "All about Rangers in 9.18!", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "Hi everyone,  A lot of people have been asking me to do an update to my old \"Korean Rangers\" guide as it is kind of outdated. And so for this reason I am doing an update. Please keep on giving me feedback or requesting me to make content on certain topics, and I'll try my best to do so.       For those that do not know. Here is the old \"Korean Rangers\" guide        Now let us move on to how Rangers should be played in 9.18. This was a longer video because I tried to cover as much as I possibly could about Rangers. However even in this 30 minute video, I did not have time to go over certain aspects too in depth, such as positioning.      Here is the video with timestamps in the description:         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **why call it Korean Rangers before and not anymore now?**  Firstly I got a lot of flack for calling it Korean Rangers before. I'd like to explain why i named it this build again. I did not do it just for some clickbaitey title, but also because of many other reasons and I thought the name was very appropriate.   At the end of 9.15 and in 9.16 Rangers were generally considered weak by NA and EU. NA and EU were only considering brawlers or nobles as strong.  Koreans were the only major region that used rangers a lot during that specific time in 9.16 (other than maybe China, which I do not follow much), in fact it was debatably the most popular build in Korea even in the brawler + nobles meta that was also prevalent in Korea.  It was a very specific build that involved exactly 7  s and 2 core items (GA + morellos on sej or Aatrox, and either a statikk shiv or ionic spark). Focusing on the synergy for phantom and having the rangers as more of a supportive role for their frontliners.  Aatrox was very rarely used as a ranger component in NA or EU ranger comps.  Due to balance changes that specific build, is no longer the strongest Ranger build and is outdated. We will talk about how to play rangers now in 9.18, where every major region has been playing them and consider Rangers very strong.      Right now, all regions consider rangers strong and all regions are playing them, and there are many different ways to play rangers, so to keep on calling different ranger builds Korean Rangers now does not make much sense. The Korean Rangers build, was a very specific 7   team that had a very specific idea behind it, as well as itemization.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **What has changed since 9.16?**  Guinsoo's Rageblade buff and Rangers attack speed buff - This means that items such as Statikk Shiv or Ionic Spark are no longer as useful as before in the new meta.  Much less Hextech, much less brawlers - This means we no longer need to position and itemize around hextech and can focus on countering other teams.  The rise of Void Assassins and shapeshifters - These comps actually destroy the old Korean Rangers, so now you need to go other ranger variations in order to do well in the meta.  Levelling, experience and gold changes - This doesn't change much for rangers, but it just changed the way the game is played in general a bit.  Rangers still very strong, they should just be played quite differently  It means Rangers can be played more as carries, rather than supporting the phantom and frontline  Ranger builds are now much more flexible and can go in multiple different directions depending on what the game gives you and what you   to counter        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Early signal to go Rangers?**  Early Ashe - She will be the main carry for your rangers almost all the time. You will be putting your items on her, so making sure you will be able to 2 * her will be very important. The earlier you find her, the higher chances you have to 2 * her early.      Mordekaiser 2 + Vayne 2 + a Varus - These  s are generally  s that just fit into tons of different ranger comps. Mordekaiser gives phantom synergy with Kindred later in the game or can be used as a knight, Vayne is a ranger and is necessary to go 4 rangers, but can also be used in the early game until later when you get your rangers for a smoother transition. Varus again is a ranger, but also rangers often enjoy a demon synergy. And in 2 ranger variations, he is often going to be used as your secondary ranger (though sometimes it can also be kindred).      Rageblade  t + cloak or spatula - Rageblade is now THE core item for Ashe. And cloak builds into either runaan's hurricane, hush or cursed blade. While spatula builds into runaans hurricane (though it can also be used for glacial, demon or knight synergies). All of these are great ranger items.      In most games you will not have all of these components. If you have all these components, we can say it is a \"perfect opener\" for rangers. In most games you will just have a few of these components, however you will have good components for other comps. I would recommend to look at your  s and items and think critically, how many components do I have for which comp? You   to recognize what your components are, stack different factors and components together and go for the comp you have the most components for (or are most comfortable with).       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Itemization for Ashe**  Statikk Shiv no longer necessary - It is now just an item we go for if we   to winstreak early game and build momentum for us. This item falls off hard lategame, however it can be worth it to build early if we can winstreak since it allows us to build a big economy, and then later in the game have a large healthpool so that we can also use health as a bit of a resource if we   to transition our comp a bit later (in order to counter the lobby).      Guinsoo's Rageblade is now a core item - It synergizes too well with ranger attack speed buff to be ignored in addition to its own buff.      Secondary item is preferably Runaan's Hurricane. Otherwise a second Guinsoo's Rageblade works, or some defensive item (Dragon's Claw vs magic Damage, PD vs assassins maybe?)  Third item is preferably an on hit disabling item such as Hush or Cursed Blade. - Hush works better vs sorcs/large CC such as sejuani, whereas cursed blade works well vs hyperoll comps such as void assassins.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Pivot  s**  These will be  s you   to be on the lookout for as they can be fit into many different ranger comps. When this   passes your shop, you will always highly consider picking it up. These are also generally either expensive  s that are harder to find, or simply highly contested  s. So this is why they are so important to note.      Seeing them in the shop does not mean you need to buy and use them, all it means is that you need to be aware of what important synergies they (could) enable and that you should consider picking them up and building a comp around them or fitting them into your comp.      KINDRED: Enables 4 rangers and phantom  BRAND: Enables demon buff and elementals  KENNEN: Enables elementals and yordles  SEJUANI: Enables knights and glacials, also just amazing frontliner + CC for rangers in general  PANTHEON or LEONA: Enables Guardians       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Early to midgame gameplay:**  Quite standard, build the strongest team you can early and find your  s and pivot later in the game... This is not a levelling/econ guide. There are plenty out there. Though I did go into it a bit more in details in the video.           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Here are some of the comps that are more common now and that can be built around a ranger core.**  Please note that I did not list all the different ranger variations, there are many out there. I just showed some examples of ranger comps that can work well in given situations. Rangers are overall, some of the most flexible comps in the game, and you can mix and match them in many different ways. You should aim to build your comp around both what  s are being given to you, as well as what the rest of the lobby is going in order to counter them. It is hard for me to say which is the best overall, because imo it totally depends on the lobby and the game. And I don't think you should go the same exact ranger build every single game right now if you   to succeed with rangers.  This is one of the core skills that differentiates the top ranger players from the rest. This is why becoming good with rangers can be a good comp to learn, since while it is hard to top 1 with rangers, they are very consistent at top 4. Which means you can definitely climb with them. And while it is hard to force any one specific rangers build every game, it is not so hard to force a ranger comp in general every single game. So learning how to play rangers properly will teach you a lot of valuable skillsets that will stay valuable into the future of TFT and it will be a good longterm investment, unlike say becoming an expert at void assassins, which can be considered a short term strategy that will not teach you nearly as much about how to play the game. (However, if someone would like me to make a guide on how to play void assassins, I can do that too xD , though I think there are already enough out there).      **\"Korean Rangers\"** (hard to call it this anymore with different itemization and idea behind build tbh) - **level 7**      - Still very viable, however you may   to now use different itemization or positioning based on the lobby.    - You may consider using Brand instead of Aatrox.   - You most likely   to get to level 8, and transition into something else such as 4 glacials or 4 knights, etc.      **4 rangers, 4 knights - level 8**      - allows you to spread out, and good vs sorcs or hard CC such as Sejuani   - Probably one of the most straightforward transitions from Korean Rangers by removing Aatrox.   - One of the worst vs Void Assassins      **4 rangers, 2 knights, 2 guardians - level 8**  [**    - Better vs physical damage such as other rangers or gunslingers or Draven comps as long as they do not have much hard CC (Sejuani, Gnar, Cho).   - Still not that great vs void assassins, but maybe a bit better since you are kind of forced to clump up anyways and Leona/Panth have some nice CC+health pools...   - Level 7 you either use Sej for frontline + tankiness, or mordekaiser for phantom, or 2 rangers.      **4 rangers + elementals**  [**    - Decent vs assassins (but you still lose to highrollers)   - Nice early to midgame spike when you hit elementals, golem functions very well as frontline   - At level 8 you would usually   to transition a bit. For example go 4 glacials either with anivia + sej, or get rid of an elemental (kennen or brand)       **4 rangers + 4 glacials**  [**    - Best vs shapeshifters and synergizes very well with Ashe with good items (guinsoos + hurricane + onhit item)   - Doesn't lose to assassins too hard   - I forgot to mention this in video? I definitely should have...      **2 rangers + elementals + 4 glacials**  [**    - Pretty good comp in the current meta in general. Does well vs shapeshifters and one of the better ranger comps into assassins.   - Strong early powerspike   - Can use Kindred + Mordekaiser for phantom + more frontline/CC if you get early Anivia with this comp, otherwise can get kindred + morde level 8 easily      **2 rangers + elementals + demons**  [**    - Lots of damage! Big early spike   - I would look to transition later in the game as it falls off. For example, get 4 demons + 4 glacials at level 8 by removing Kennen maybe.      **2 rangers + elementals + yordles**  [**    - Actually really good in current meta and imo the best ranger comp vs assasssins (unless they have multiple RFC). It also does very well vs other ranger players or gunslingers, but not too great vs Draven comps.    - I'd generally look to get 4 glacials at level 8, either with Anivia, or frozen mallet, or getting rid of elementals.      As you see there are a ton of variations, many of which I did not even list. These are just some of the more common ones that make sense. Rangers are an art of mix and matching and building based on countering the others in the lobby.      In many games you will simply not have the resources to be able to tailor your teamcomp to the rest of the lobby and counter them because you will simply be too low on health and your mission is simply to get a final teamcomp together and stay alive as long as possible. However in some games you are winning early and midgame, and the best way for you to win the game, will be to transition into a comp that most counters the strongest people in the lobby who you are most likely to face when it comes to that remaining 2 to 3 players left.        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     **F.A.Q.**  Similar to my last guide. I'll be doing a F.A.Q here. Where any good and relevant questions will get answered in this F.A.Q. I will constantly update this F.A.Q. for the next couple days. If I decided not to reply to you personally it is probably because the answer will already be in the F.A.Q. or the question/answer is not relevant to this build guide.      **Q:** Can I force this build every game.  **A:** The higher ELO you get the less I would advise to force a comp. I would recommend to have some comps in mind before the game, and then depending on which key pieces you pick up go into that comp (I listed key pieces earlier in the guide for this comp).  Regarding rangers specifically. I believe it is possible to force some variation of rangers every game, however trying to force only one specific rangers variation (for example knights + rangers) won't yield as much success (unlike forcing void assassins every game, that can be very successful).      **Q:** How would you rate the build?  **A:** Rangers in general are considered A to S tier now. But to really succeed with them, you need to play them properlly and make the correct transitions.      **Q:** Top 4 comp or Top 1?  **A:** One of the most consistent top 4 comps, that being said it is much harder to top 1 with rangers than for example void assassins. The best ranger players would typically place between 2nd and 4th depending on factors such as matchmaking and the rest of the lobby.      **Q:** What counters this?  **A:** Void assassins has been consistently strong vs all comps this patch if they hit exodia (Kassadin 3 * with RFC and level 7 with one or 2 other 3 *). However for other comps, it all depends on who highrolls more and what is the exact ranger comp. For example shapeshifters usually beat rangers, unless the ranger player has 4+ glacials and great itemization on Ashe then the ranger player will usually win, etc.      **Q:** Any VoDs or streams to see this in action?  **A:** Tons of high ELO players play rangers very often (as well as other comps).  Here are some of the top players who play rangers a lot (I'm sure I am missing some).  Deliciousmilk (rank 1 NA):    K3sojuu (rank 2 NA):    DarkHydra (rank 2 EUW):    Alanzq (rank 1 EUW):    I'm sure I'm missing a ton of people, but these are the main people I'll watch sometimes that do play rangers quite often if they get good openers for them       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Again the 30 min youtube video which may go into some additional details is here:           ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **About me**  2x Challenger player, and just got a 2nd smurf to GM at the  t of this patch           Analyst for Proguides [www.proguides.com]  where I do VoD reviews 2-3x a week  Catch me at my twitch stream where I stream most days of the week:    My youtube channel where I post these video guides and some good games/moments from stream:", "id": "d5epzv", "num_comments": 26, "created_utc": 1568714077},

{"title": "Yordles + Shapeshifters + Dragons + Sorc In-Depth Challenger Guide!", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "Hello everyone,  This will be my first guide for this patch 9.17, I previously wrote a few other guides such as (these are still quite viable in the meta):  Evelynn carry:        Korean Rangers:          I   to once again bring out a build comp that is not yet too popular, however it is definitely picking up! I'm sure with the strength of this build it will soon be very popular. This time not inspired by Koreans, but simply something that I have been playing myself quite a bit this patch to climb. I theory crafted this build at the  t of the patch and experimented with it a lot and have found good success with it. I've seen a lot of other players use this too, or have a similar idea, so for sure, it is not something totally groundbreaking, however although shapeshifters are meta, this particular variation of shapeshifters is certainly not meta yet and it is just something I didn't copy specifically from any one player or regions meta but rather a guide that is built mostly from my own experience with this comp. For those of you who are familiar with the former yordles + elementalists + sorc that Keane previously used a lot, this build will seem quite familiar and you'll feel very comfortable with it.  Before I wrote a guide, I  ed to make sure this was viable and test it out myself. It proved itself to be viable, I gained about 2  LP and climbed from low challenger to highish challenger with this as one of my main builds on my main in only about 20 games. It does extremely well in this current meta, where shapeshifters are very strong, and it also acts as a good counter to the other meta comps such as assassins and rangers.         Let's get into the guide:  Firstly you can check out the 18 min video version with timestamps going into some more details here:         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **The Build Concept:**  At the  t of the patch, I knew shapeshifters would be strong, I just struggled to make them work. It was hard for me to get to 6 shapeshifters. I found that it relied so much on finding Swain (and often Pantheon for Dragon), not only that but while I was hunting for Swain, I had to keep my other shapeshifters on the bench and it felt like I was just wasting so much gold in a meta that has sped up. 6 Shapeshifters is like the ultimate lategame comp now, similar to 6 nobles was previously, however lategame comps are less consistent and reliable now as the meta is more early-midgame focused now. We reach lategame much less frequently, so trying to bank on hitting a lategame comp is much more risky now. Instead now we should focus on trying to find a strong midgame comp, and then use that to transition into the lategame. This comp focuses on gathering only 3 shapeshifters, and if you reach the lategame you can have multiple transition options, including going into 6 shapeshifters if you   as you got a great setup for it.      The focus behind this build is getting Gnar, arguably now the strongest champ in the game to become as big and scary as possible. It is going to use his 2 syngergies, yordles and shapeshifters to enable him, along with his best partner Kennen as his supprtive carry. The third yordle will always be Lulu, a great sorc to support your shapeshifters. It creates a level 7 squad of perfect synergies. Many of the  s are highly contested. But you really don't need to get them all to 2 * immediately as the synergies work so well together that even if half your team is 1 * you will find yourself crushing opponents with this comp at level 7, allowing you to either reroll and try to upgrade  s, or econ and add in a  /synergy and have a higher chance of finding those  s later at a higher level, maybe once others have been kicked out of the game.      This is what your ideal level 7 squad will look like:     **Gnar:** The key carry, arguably the current strongest   in the game. You only need Gnar 1 to get top 4, get Gnar 2 and you will be fighting for 1st (depends how early you get Gnar and how others are high/lowrolling). With sorc bonus he will deal tons of damage with his ultimate, and with yordle bonus he will be unkillable even without GA.  **Kennen:** Insane synergy with Gnar. Gnar can throw teams into Kennen ult and it's the biggest wombo combo in the game. Also enables yordle synergy with Gnar and Lulu.  **Nidalee:** Gives Gnar Wild buff, completes shapeshifter bonus.  **Shyvana:** Our 3rd shapeshifter, who will get us dragon buff.  **Aurelion Sol:** Our main sorc dps lategame, gives us dragon synergy with shyvana. Early on, only need Asol 1 in order to get Dragon bonus, later in the game, he transitions into a carry as we upgrade Asol to 2 * and  t putting items on him later.  **Lulu:** 3rd yordle who also grants sorc bonus. Also one of the best sorcs to help out shapeshifters in general. Can also have Veigar instead, but Lulu synergizes so well with shapeshifters, I think leaving her out is kind of a mistake.  **Morgana:** This is the most flexible  , Morgana is not necessary but my preferred 3rd sorc, only because it means at level 8 it opens up the possibility to give us an extra demon, or because Darkin is also a really good item on Gnar. However you could also go with Twisted Fate for the blue cards, or with Ahri and try to get Wild 4 at level 8. But my personal favorite is Morgana. Later in the game, we can of course switch her for Karthus or something.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **Itemization:**  You   to stack Gnar and Kennen with items. Prioritize getting a Giants belt in the first carousel because this build can basically never have enough Giants belts.  But really there are just two core items, and they are both for Kennen, so he can be useful. Gnar will be scary even without items or with random items.  **Kennen** absolutely  s a **Guardians Angel!**  He also benefit from **Morellos** and **Redemption** but these two are not as key.   **Guardians Angel** is the number one most important item on Kennen to allow him to get his ultimate off.      **Gnar** can honestly use a ton of different items. I'm still not sure what is the best on him. My preferred items on Gnar right now is the **Warmogs**  + **Titanic Hydra** combo. Titanic Hydra works really well on Gnar since, when Gnar transforms, he gains a ton of health and **Titanic Hydra** means Gnar will deal a % of his max health as damage. So **Warmogs** synergizes really well with that also. As a 3rd item, I prefer **Dragons Claw** in this meta and to make Gnar magic immune. Gnar really doesn't need GA as much since he only needs to ult once, and with good positioning and a warmogs he is basically guaranteed to ult (at least at 2 *).      That being said, Gnar can use a ton of items well. Items like Statikk Shiv, GA, Guinsoo's Rageblade, Frozen Heart, Darkin, Yuumi, all work fine on him as well as others.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Level 7 full build**:     Tips:   - Stack items on Gnar and Kennen early. If you put GA + Morellos on Kennen he is still useful even at 1 *, same for Gnar if you put items on him early. Later in the game, focus on getting items onto Asol (Shojins, RFC, guinsoos, etc).   - Keep Gnar on second row or backrow unless he has either darkin or GA (or both) to guarantee a Gnar ult.   - Once Kennen has GA, frontline him in enemy face so that he hits as many people as possible. If vs assassins, you can put Kennen in center of your team.   - Early game item holders. Anyone who uses the items well... Personally I really like Ahri or TF for Kennen + Asol items, she uses Morellos + GA + Asol items very well. For shapeshifters you can either use some early game carry like Garen/Darius or another early game shapeshifter that you plan on selling like Elise or Jayce until you find Gnar. Can also use Poppy to get early yordle bonus with Lulu + Kennen, until you find Gnar.   - Put in Gnar immediately all the time. He is really strong, you should have been saving up items for him on someone earlier and as long as he got items he is very strong even at 1 *. He also usually completes some synergy you've been waiting for.   - Asol, sometimes can wait and build him up to 2 *, if Shyvana is already 2 * and we got 3 shapeshifters, I usually prefer to put Asol in immediately to give Shyvana dragon buff already, but if we have Shyvana 1 and another sorc at 2 * like Ahri or TF, then I would prefer to keep Asol on bench until then. Depends on the game.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Here are some potential power ups at level 8**  Level 8: Add a strong demon:    One of the main reasons why Morgana is my preferred 3rd sorc after Lulu and Asol are since it means we have a very simply transition into level 8. We level up, and get our 2nd demon I prefer Brand, though if we can't find Brand, Evelynn or Aatrox also work. Of course Swain works great too, but I rather have 2 * Brand or Eve than Swain 1 without items.      Level 8: 4 wilds    Not my preferred version since I find Gnar is the biggest beneficiary of Wild Buff, but Asol, Shyvana, Lulu do use the Wild Buff quite well. I just find a strong demon such as Brand so much more powerful, especially with Sorc buff.      Level 8: Add a strong legendary:    Karthus and Pantheon are the most obvious choices. But any really works.      Level 9 ultimate teamcomp natural transition, 6 shapeshifters, 3 sorc, 2 dragons:    Let's say we are very strong and having a good game, we can guarantee victory by getting to 9 and getting 6 shapeshifters + 3 sorc + dragons, 90%+ of the games, the game will end before this, but this is some fairytale ending comp that the original level 7 comp allows us to transition into smoothly. We do this by preparing our team at level 8 and econing, only do this if very strong and knowing that we will be able to hit level 9. I would typically use one of the level 8 variations, and then econ and pick up Swain and keep him on the bench (unless 2 *). Pick up Jayce and Elise (or maybe you already saved them), and then at level 9 get rid of Kennen and whatever 8th   you had. Kennen's items go onto Swain (GA+Morellos) et voila.       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **What if I cannot find key  s? Is there a backup plan?**  This build has a similar build path to yordles/ele/sorc. It is easy to transition into that if you find Brand.          Also there are some other interesting shapeshifter variations you can go into with a similar build path, if you find Gnar, but not Asol. These also work very well. Here is yordles + knights + guardians + shapeshifters, which needs level 8 and pantheon and Sejuani (harder to get, but follows the same buildpath if you highroll panth+sej).        Here is yordles + elementals + shapeshifters. With this, you can easily stabilize at level 7 and get to the same level 8 comp with brand earlier (replace Lissandra and Poppy for Asol and Lulu) :        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         **F.A.Q.**  Similar to my last guide. I'll be doing a F.A.Q here. Where any good and relevant questions will get answered in this F.A.Q. I will constantly update this F.A.Q. for the next couple days. If I decided not to reply to you personally it is probably because the answer will already be in the F.A.Q. or the question/answer is not relevant to this build guide.         **Q:** Can I force this build every game.  **A:** The higher ELO you get the less I would advise to force a comp. I would recommend to have some comps in mind before the game, and then depending on which key pieces you pick up go into that comp (I listed key pieces earlier in the guide for this comp). However rank 1 EUNE has basically been forcing this exact comp, basically every single game and having success with it with his 40% winrate.           **Q:** How would you rate the build?  **A:** Well right now, I basically only run some assassin variation, or ranger variation, or this. Personally I rate it as S tier, but you may disagree :)     **Q:** Top 4 comp or Top 1?  **A:** Top 4 if you find Gnar 1 and Asol 1 (and other  s are 2 *). With Gnar 2 and Asol 2 and level 8 upgrades, you'll be fighting for top 1.      **Q:** What counters this?  **A:** I think that reroll void assassin strategy does well if it highrolls and gets a bunch of 3 *  s can do well vs this. Otherwise, not much other than some super highroller with key 3 *  s, or 6 shapeshifter with swain 2.      **Q:** Any VoDs or streams to see this in action?  **A:** TBH, I did not copy this from anyone or know anyone who forces this comp often (other than arcelate now, but I don't know if he streams). So I can just suggest to check out my own stream :)           **Q:** Is this comp proven to work?  **A:** Rank 1 EUNE basically has been forcing it every game (I just found out about this, just before I decided to write this guide), and I have climbed 2 + LP with it in challenger in  25 games.                   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **About me**  2x Challenger player             Analyst for Proguides [www.proguides.com]  where I do VoD reviews 2-3x a week      Catch me at my twitch stream where I stream most days of the week:         My youtube channel where I post these video guides and some good games/moments from stream:", "id": "cz8ozp", "num_comments": 94, "created_utc": 1567535011}, 
{"title": "Lose streak (02-Sep-2019)", "author": "Mijg1210", "selftext": "Chinese players call this Mai(4)Xue(3) translated as selling blood.  **The reason behind lose streak strategy**   When you have a bad  t (items and champions), you will not win the first few PvP rounds anyway.   You can opt to lose streak so that you do not fall behind too much in gold income.   If you get the 0(item),1,2,6 gold opening, you can even consider selling all champions and \"open fort\".  **Pros:**   1st pick for item you need at Stage 2 and even Stage 3 Carousel   Lose streak allows you to keep up gold income   Makes you look like a pro if you are successful   **Cons:**   Losing too much HP is risky   Even with gold to level and reroll for upgrades, you might still be unable to stop \"bleeding\"   Stressful and not for the faint of heart  **How to  t**   Scout to see if there are other players who are going for lose streak.   If you find a suspect, build the weakest comp possible or consider \"open fort\".   Sample of how to place champions for Stage 2-1.       Maintain your lose streak by scouting other players to ensure you are not stronger.   You should aim to defeat as many enemy champions as you can but lose the round.   Taking few damage is the difficult part about the strategy.  **Changes to leveling system are planned in future patches and this guide may not be relevant then.**  **Terms used**   HP - Little Legend's health (hit points or health points)   Econ - Economy management by maximising interest you get for the round e.g. 20g for 2g interest   Comp - Composition of your build with champions you recruited from store  **Gold**   You get less gold at Stages 1-1 to 1-3 (2+3+4).    ting Stage 2-1, you get:   Base 5g (every round)   Interest 0-5g (1g for every 10 gold you have at  t of round)   Win/ Lose Streak 0-3g   Win PvP round 1g   Pirate synergy 0-4g (not discussed in this guide)   Hence, you can earn 5-18g every round.  **Win/ Lose Streak explanation**   Gain an additional 1g when at 2-3 wins/ losses in a row   Gain an additional 2g when at 4-6 wins/ losses in a row   Gain an additional 3g when at 7+ wins/ losses in a row  **For comparison purposes**   Player A (Win streak)   Player B (No win/ lose streak)   Player C (Lose streak)   All 3 players did not get any gold from first 3 creep rounds.   They have 11g at Stage 2-1 (2+2+3+4).   They always keep 5g worth of champions on their bench from Stage 2-2 onwards.  **Leveling and expenses**   Player A levels to 4 at Stage 2-1, 5 at Stage 2-4, 6 at Stage 3-1 and 7 at Stage 4-1.   Player B and C levels to 5 at Stage 2-6, 6 at Stage 3-3 and 7 at Stage 4-2.   No gold is spent on rerolls before leveling to 6 and 7.   The reroll gold spent by each player after leveling is 4g at level 6 and 12g at level 7.   They did not lose during creep rounds.

{"title": "Lose streak (02-Sep-2019)", "author": "Mijg1210", "selftext": "Chinese players like to call this Mai(4)Xue(3) translated as selling blood.  **The reason behind lose streak strategy**   When you have a bad  t (items and champions), you will not win the first few PvP rounds anyway.   You can opt to lose streak so that you do not fall behind too much in gold income.   If you get the 0(item),1,2,6 gold opening, you can even consider selling all champions and \"open fort\".  **Pros:**   1st pick for item you need at Stage 2 and even Stage 3 Carousel   Lose streak allows you to keep up gold income   Makes you look like a pro if you are successful  **Cons:**   Losing too much HP is risky   Even with gold to level and reroll for upgrades, you might still be unable to stop \"bleeding\"   Stressful and not for the faint of heart  **Changes to leveling system are planned in future patches and this guide may not be relevant then.**  **Terms used**   HP - Little Legend's health (hit points or health points)   Econ - Economy management by maximising interest you get for the round e.g. 20g for 2g interest   Comp - Composition of your build with champions you recruited from store  **Gold**   You get less gold at Stages 1-1 to 1-3 (2+3+4).    ting Stage 2-1, you get:   Base 5g (every round)   Interest 0-5g (1g for every 10 gold you have at  t of round)   Win/ Lose Streak 0-3g   Win PvP round 1g   Pirate synergy 0-4g (not discussed in this guide)   Hence, you can earn 5-18g every round.  **Win/ Lose Streak explanation**   Gain an additional 1g when at 2-3 wins/ losses in a row   Gain an additional 2g when at 4-6 wins/ losses in a row   Gain an additional 3g when at 7+ wins/ losses in a row  **For comparison purposes**   Player A (Win streak)   Player B (No win/ lose streak)   Player C (Lose streak)   All 3 players did not get any gold from first 3 creep rounds.   They have 11g at Stage 2-1 (2+2+3+4).

Player B and C levels to 5 at Stage 2-6, 6 at Stage 3-3 and 7 at Stage 4-2.   No gold is spent on rerolls before leveling to 6 and 7.   The reroll gold spent by each player after leveling is 4g at level 6 and 12g at level 7.   They did not lose during creep rounds.

{"title": "VOID 6 ASSASSINS - 1792+ MMR (28-Aug-2019)", "author": "Mijg1210", "selftext": "Many Chinese players are playing this build and one of them is huya `mengzi (1792+ MMR).     In this game, both the 2nd and 4th place were playing this build.  Screenshots: 1792 MMR, Comp  [China 1792 MMR]       [Both 2nd and 4th place were playing this comp]       I just hit Masters in the Singapore server by forcing 6 Assassins 5 out of 6 games.  5th game was won with Draven 6 NOBLES.  For the last (6th) game, I was 8th place with 4hp left (Stage 4-3) and ended up winning 12 rounds in a row and won.  My results with forcing 6 Assassins for five games were 1,6,1,2,1.      Screenshots: 6th game final comp, proof of Masters, five games' results and comps      [6th game - 4hp at Stage 4-3 and 12 wins in a row]       [Masters]       [1st game]       [2nd game]       [3rd game]       [4th game]       [6th game]   **INTRO**  I am an average player, stuck in Diamond II for a long time (highest was Diamond I 50)  It is hard to gain LP as there are fewer players here compared to other regions.  Like many of us, I learned everything from Twitch streamers.  I even watched VODs of pros like DarkHydra and jinsooo0 and tried to study how they play.  However, it was impossible for me to gain an edge over other players.  I can't seem to get 1st and 2nd place consistently and the occassional 7th or 8th place loss meant a huge loss of LP.  Sometimes I even get 0 LP for 3rd place finishes in my games.  My only 4 wins from the last ten days or so were all with 6 NOBLES.  Until.  I watched a Chinese player's stream and learned about 6 ASSASSINS.      **If you think..**  6 Assassins are like 3 patches ago.  Outdated and fragile (dies easily).  Block each other and vunerable to AOE.  Hard to 2 * Akali.  Hard to 2 * Cho'Gath.      All of the above don't matter much.  Even if you don't find Cho'Gath, you can use Kassadin (missing 2 BRAWLER bonus).  Zed is first choice carry.  You go for Akali unless you can't find Zed or if there is another assassin player with more Zeds.      OFFENSE - 6 ASSASSINS have high crit damage. VOID true damage.  DEFENSE - Only Cho'Gath.  CONTROL - Pyke and Cho'Gath.      **FINAL BUILD**  Level - 7  Items - Spatula and B.F. Sword (for a Youmuu's Ghostblade on Rek'Sai)  Champions - Kha'Zix, Zed, Pykes, Rengar, Evelynn, Rek'Sai and Cho'Gath  Carry - Zed or any other assassin you like      **Early game (Stage 1-1 to 1-3)**   -1. Fight for a Spatula or B.F. Sword at the first carousell.   -2. Pray for Spatula and B.F. Sword to drop during first 3 rounds of creeps.   -3. If you get the 2 items before first PVP round, you are good to go.  Depending on your items and champions, you should consider going for other builds if you do not get either one.  Youmuu's Ghostblade is essential as you get to complete your build at level 7 and do not need Katarina.  For my 4th game, I did not have Youmuu's Ghostblade and had to level to 8 just to add Katarina (Spending 46 more gold).   -4. If you have either of the items and still   to go 6 ASSASSINS.      **Lose streak (Stage 2-1 to 2-3)**   -5. Put out weak champions and lose as you   1st pick at the carousell. This is important.   -6. Keep Zed, Kha'Zix, Rek'Sai and Pykes. Use Kassadin for 3 Voids until you find Cho'Gath.   -7. If Rengar, Evelynn or comes early, try not to pick them as your economy is important.    -8. Hope for item you need at Stage 2-4 carousell.  Level 4 Comp: Any 4 Champions to lose streak with (Not important)      **Continuing lose streak (Stage 2-4 to 3-3)**   -9. You can put up stronger champions but try to maintain your lose streak.   -10. Level to 5 at Stage 2-6 Krugs and make sure to beat them.   -11. At Stage 3-1, you have a choice of leveling to 6 and spending a little on rerolls if you have not found your 2 * champions.   -12. If you don't mind losing more health, you can save for 2 more rounds and do it at Stage 3-3.  Level 5 Comp: Kassadin, Kha'Zix, Rek'Sai, Zed and Pyke      **Still losing? Continue to manage economy (Stage 3-4 to 3-6)**   -13. Pray for item you need at Stage 3-4 carousell. Hopefully you should have already made your Youmuu's Ghostblade and placed on Rek'Sai.   -14. If the other players are strong, you may still be losing, hopefully not too badly by now.   -15. DO NOT REROLL too much gold as you need to level to 7.   -16. Manage the gold you spend on rerolls and aim for 3 * champions especially Zed.   -17. You should beat Murk Wolves easily.  Level 6 Comp: Kassadin, Kha'Zix, Rek'Sai, Zed, Pyke and Rengar/ Evelynn      **Final comp showdown (Stage 4-1 and onwards)**   -18. Most players level to 7 after Murk Wolves or are already level 7.   -19. Here, you have another choice to level at Stage 4-1 or 4-2 (Econ for 1 more round).   -20. By Stage 4-2, you MUST be level 7 and reroll to get all your champions 2 * or even 3 * (If lucky with rerolls).   -21. After you have 6 assassins on board, you should  t to win.  Completed Level 7 Comp: Kha'Zix, Rek'Sai, Zed, Pyke, Rengar, Evelynn and Cho'Gath      **End game**   -22. Reroll to try get 1 and 2 cost champions to 3 *. You can even get 3 cost champions to 3 * if you like and you have the economy to support.   -23. Personally I like to level to 8 but but you can choose to stay at level 7 and reroll.   -24. At level 8, put in any 2 * strong   you like.  Blitzcrank to PULL an enemy champion.  Gnar for WILD bonus to Rengar.  Brand for DEMON bonus for Evelynn.  Or another Cho'Gath.  Or another Akali if you went for Akali option.  Level 8 Comp: Kha'Zix, Rek'Sai, Zed, Pyke, Rengar, Evelynn, Cho'Gath and ANY 2 *            There is always a chance you won't manage to make a Youmuu's Ghostblade for the entire game  Depending on items and champions, you can consider going VOID BRAWLER SORCERERS or other builds.  For my 6th game, I did not find any assassins early game and there was also another assassin player with early 2 * Zed.  You can see from the final build that he got 3 * Zed in the end.  I found a 2 * Ahri and 2 * Lulu after at level 6 and was planning to go Sorcerers.  Then at Stage 3-4 carousell I managed to make a Youmuu's Ghostblade and decided to go back to Assassins.  That was really dumb and I almost got 8th place. I was at 4 hp at Stage 4-3 or something.      **Items?**  To be honest, no one has control over what items he gets.  Even during carousell, the item you   may not appear or another player can beat you to it.  This build is good as you only need one full item. A Youmuu's Ghostblade on Rek'Sai.  As for other items, build according to what you get.  If you  , you can try to build Rapid Firecannon and Sword of the Divine on 3 * Zed.  I like Rek'Sai who does pure damage and I placed some items on him in my 6th game. (1st screenshot)      **Positioning?**  Everyone bottom. Cho'Gath is the only visible   and try to ensure enemy champions walk out towards him.  Be careful of Hextech disables.      **Top 4?**  I only played 5 games with it so I don't really know. However, the top Chinese players are playing it at high MMR (17 +) so this build should not be too bad.      **Notes?**  You should have at least 1 visible champion at anytime and not all assassins.  If you don't like to lose streak and are confident of winning, you can try to win early.  At level 6 and 7, the probability for rolling 2 cost   is 35% and 30%.  I don't recommend to 3 * Zed at level 6 as you might spend too much gold on rerolls.  You can always reroll at level 7 at lower percentage.  Try not to have both Zed and Akali on board as you lose NINJA bonus.  This is only a simple guideline but you should play however you like.  I did not play well and I believe that others can play this build better.       Sorry if my formatting is bad. Not much experience posting.       **TLDR:**  I learned 6 ASSASSINS from a top Chinese players' stream (1792 MMR) and forced the build 5/6 games and got to Masters.  It is a simple build which is completed at level 7 and only requires one Youmuu's Ghostblade for Rek'Sai.  If you fail to get a Youmuu's Ghostblade, you can still go to level 8 and add Katarina.", "id": "cwg71h", "num_comments": 43, "created_utc": 1566968624}, 
{"title": "Evelyyn Carry is getting HOT in Korea. Here is how they play it!", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "Hey everyone.  I'm XPT and I'm a challenger player on EUW (and pretty much challenger on NA too now, maybe gotta grind another day on NA account for that). I'm back with a new guide with a build inspired by the Koreans. Thanks for all the feedback so far by the way so far on my other guides, overall it has been very good.   Here are the recent guides I wrote that are still relevant in the meta (although they are unupdated, and maybe I would change a couple of minor details):  Korean Rangers:        The Void Game Tree:        6 Nobles:        In this new guide I will talk about the new flavor of the week over in Korea, this is Evelynn. I have been spending many hours analyzing top Korean streamers. Most recently I have been checking out SCSC95 as he is the one that has been streaming the most recently out of him, Jinsoo, and Portialyn. And over the past few days, I have been surprised to see Evelynn get more and more popular on the Korean server, to the point where now, she is in fact the most contested 3 cost   in the entire game. Everyone is picking her up and fitting her into various comps. Although there is one comp in particular that the Koreans seem to prefer the most if possible. This guide is going to try and cover that particular build.      20 min video guide with timestamps in description:         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **The concept behind this build composition**  There was a build in Reddit earlier that had similar concepts, which was to try and get 6 knights and fit in Evelynn with another carry. This is quite similar, but a bit optimized as it is easier to reach since you won't need to pick up Kayle. Also some of the 1 cost knights such as Garen, Darius, Mordekaiser, simply lose value the longer the game goes on as  s. Instead of getting 6 knights, we   to get guardians, and at least 2 knights.      The lategame team composition will be consisted of 6 core  s then:    Evelynn: She will be our main carry who we   to prioritize getting items onto.  Brand: This is the preferred second demon. Not only is Brand simply an amazing   right now, but also Brand synergizes very well with Evelynn, since Eve deals burst damage but might not finish targets off. Brand helps Eve a lot, his ult will either bring a target down low enough for Eve to execute the target, or Evelynn will ult first leaving targets low while Brand cleans up. Though we can use Varus (preferably) or another demon as a filler until we find Brand.  Sejuani: The best knight in the game after Kayle with a game breaking ultimate. Bring tankiness, frontline, and AOE CC.  Poppy: Another very good knight, though Kayle would be preferred in the lategame.  Braum and Leona: Guardians to buff up our most important  s. But Braum + Sejuani does also offer Glacial synergy which is not insignificant.      With this build, you will find that Evellyn will be extremely tanky and protected by the knights + guardians. The demon proc allows her to ult more frequently and she will often be the last person standing in your team but still be able to single handedly take down entire teams. Brand is going to be Evelynn's partner, who either finishes off any low health champs for Evelynn, or    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Early game**  Pick up as many knights and demons as you can. In the lategame, your comp will usually have either have 4 knights or 4 demons along with those 6 core  s. Also make sure to pick up Braum and Leona. Regarding levelling and eco, quite standard and depends game to game how strong you are. Usually level up to 6 after krugs and 7 after wolves. This is a build guide that isn't focused on levelling/eco so we won't cover that much here.      Ideally you will have Evelynn + at least one other demon and 2 knights. Varus is a great early demon to pick up as he can hold Brand items really well, and then later once we find Brand 2 we can put in Brand and transfer items. Although if we find Aatrox and Morgana earlygame, they should also be used in general with Evelynn. Demons overall, seem very popular in Korea.       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Itemization**  Ideally we would put 3 exact items onto Evelynn. These 3 items are:  **Dragons Claw:** Makes Evelynn take extremely little damage from any magic damage or abilities.   **Guardian Angel:** Evelynn already is one of the only  s in the game who can stop being focused after each ult (the other one is Rengar). GA also does this. GA also helps to clean up fights as the last person standing in the team.   **Hextech Gunblade:** If there is no anti heal, then she can pretty much get back all her health from one execution. This also helps her to deal some extra damage.  Other items that can work for her are tanky items. Items such as Warmogs or Phantom Dancer can work. As for damage items, Koreans prefer not to put too much extra damage on her as her ult already deals more than enough damage. Mana items such as seraphs or Ludens are not bad though. But defensive items such as those mentioned above are the prefered 3.  Since stacking Evelynn with items is so important. I would suggest to try pick up a sword early game as we can build GA and Hextech Gunblade with it. Although Rod or Negatron Cloak are not bad either.      Other general items that are always good:  **More Guardians Angels:** Can work well on champions such as Sejuani or Aatrox or Swain.  **Morellonomicon:** Great item for both Sejuani or Brand. Right now, Koreans prefer to put it on Brand.      Those would be the main items. After this, Koreans prefer to put items onto **Brand**. Other than Morellos on Brand, Brand really excels with attack speed items as he is an elemental and elementals gain double mana from autoattacks. This means items such as Shojins Spear, Guinsoo's Rageblade, Statikk Shiv, RFC, Runaans Hurricane, all work great with Brand.        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Lategame end builds**  At level 7 there isn't usually much you can add if you already got the 6 core  s. However a lot of times, you won't have the 6 core  s at level 6, and still have some unupgraded  s or transitional  s. In this case, you   to complete that 6 man core squad at level 7, whilst preparing for level 8.  That being said, if you do pick up an early spatula. There are very good uses for it, to give you an earlier power spike at level 7. You will be able to pick up 4 of a kind at level 7 already. The preferred use of spatula right now by the Koreans is Darkin   Knights Vow   Frozen Mallet.  **Level 7 Darkin:** [**   You can also replace Aatrox for Morgana or Swain. But basically you got 4 demons.      **Level 7 Knights Vow:** [**   Here I replaced GA on Eve for Knights Vow. Not sure if maybe it is better to put it on Brand or a Guardian in this situation. But you get 4 knights.      **Level 7 frozen mallet:** [**   Glacial isn't super highly valued, but this allows us to get elementals at level 8.      Now if we don't have a spatula item, we generally just collect  s on our bench that we could potentially put in at level 8 to get 4 demons or 4 knights, whilst having a 3rd demon or knight out in the arena.      **Level 8 4 demons example:** [**   Here I stacked items onto our 3 strongest demons in this comp. Very strong lategame. With a GA+Redemption on Aatrox, which is a great combo, and stacking Brand also allowed him to do tons of damage, where in this stage in the game we should definitely have him 2 * by now.     **Level 8 4 knights example:** [**   In general I think 4 demons is the better version, as with 4 knights we won't have much use for a 1 cost  . Though if we find Kayle, she is amazing and this is where she can very well fit in certainly. Also if we use Mordekaiser or Darius, then if we level up to 9, we could get 2 imperials or phantom, which will be a good upgrade in the hyper lategame.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **F.A.Q.**  Similar to my last guide. I'll be doing a F.A.Q here. Where any good and relevant questions will get answered in this F.A.Q. I will constantly update this F.A.Q. for the next couple days. If I decided not to reply to you personally it is probably because the answer will already be in the F.A.Q. or the question/answer is not relevant to this build guide.      **Q:** Can I force this build every game.   **A:**  The higher ELO you get the less I would advise to force a comp. I would recommend to have some comps in mind before the game, and then depending on which key pieces you pick up go into that comp (I listed key pieces earlier in the guide for this comp). But I would think that since this is currently not so meta in EU or NA, that it can be forced quite easily right now and get consistent top 4.       **Q:** How would you rate the build?  **A:** I have limited experience and am currently testing this out a lot/trying to abuse it for a bit before it maybe gets meta in the west. Though I did beat a lategame nobles team with it that had 3 item 2 * yasuo, and 3 item GP and also stacked Lucian and a Jinx. So I definitely think it is viable, I'm not sure how I would rate it yet. Though judging by how contested Evelynn is, they would rate her as S tier.      **Q:** Top 4 comp or Top 1?  **A:** Seems like a comp that has a good early spike and can power through to lategame and keep being strong in lategame to get top 1. Though definitely lategame, you might run into a situation where Evelynn can no longer 1v9 so you need to have other strong  s around her and ramp up the rest of your team. Overall I'd say a very smooth powercurve but not especially strong in any single part of the game, probably there are comps that are better at a certain point of the game such as earlygame, midgame or lategame. But this comp feels very smooth even if not super strong at any point (such as nobles that everyone knows is super strong lategame, but can struggle a bit earlier).      **Q:** What counters this?  **A:** Put Dragons Claw on your carries, especially your backline carries such as Ashe/Draven/Jinx   a Dragons Claw vs Evelynn otherwise she will just oneshot them. Healing reduction such as Red buff/Morellos is good vs Evelynn also. Hush is also good.      **Q:** Any VoDs or streams to see this in action?  **A:** I would suggest to check out any of the top Korean Streamers. Recently, I have mostly been watching SCSC95 as he has been streaming the most the past few days. (   Other Korean streamers I would suggest to check out would be Jinsoo:    Portialyn:     You can also see this on Keane's stream when he plays in Korea:         They may not play the comp themselves in that game, but you will certainly see at least one other person in the lobby pick up Evelynn and use this comp, if not multiple.      As for a VoD, here is a VoD where I beat 6 nobles (I was basically forcing the comp from the very  t since I picked up an early hextech gunblade and Evelynn), I wouldn't recommend such as early force.        **Q:** Is this comp proven to work?  **A:** It is the new FOTW comp in Korea. Not proven yet on NA or EU, but Evelynn is now the most contested champion in korea as she is used not only in this comp that focuses on her, but also she is used in other comps such as demon comps or assassin comps. Maybe there could be some more optimization to this comp. Although this seems to me like a more optimized version of the previous 6 knights + eve carry earlier that was used a bit in NA.       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  20 min video guide with timestamps in description:     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **About me:**  Thank you for reading and watching the guide and all the great feedback you have given me for all of these in general!

{"title": "Casual player road to Challenger w/ detailed Brawler/Assassin build", "author": "yuanek1", "selftext": "Hi there! I'm CrazyYuan, a fresh challenger player from EUNE. It took me exactly 101 games to reach Challenger, playing 2-3 games a day since the ranked went live. I just  ed to show that you don't need to grind a lot to get better and share some tips which helped me made my final push from D3 to Challenger along with a detailed explanation of the build I forced.  Proof:    **Tips:**  1. **Watch ONE high-elo streamer of your choice**   I think the biggest improvement came when I managed to simplify my approach to the game. Earlier I was watching a lot of streamers and trying to mimic ALL their playstyles which was simply too much to handle. At some point, I discovered Dark Hydra whose consistent approach to the game suited me the most and just binge-watched a lot of his content. Of course, you can choose any streamer you  , just make sure to stick to one approach. All tips below I've basically learned from watching Dark Hydra play, so credits to him! 2. **Eco is the way**   Here's what I do nowadays    - Almost level before Krugs and save up a lot of gold - eco is more reliable than win streaking    - Level to 5. once at Krugs    - Level to 6. and roll at Stage 3-3 with  ~50 gold and  ~50-70hp    - Playing predefined builds with 2-cost or 3-cost carry (I forced Assasin/Brawlers for the straight 15 games with 80% top4 finish rate, though the best, but harder approach would be to be a little more flexible and have more builds to choose from)    - Save up gold when I know I am strong enough to do so (this is vital for pushing for top 1-2)   **So why this works?**    - You sacrifice one choice which may be suboptimal (choosing the build based on the limited information you have at Krugs) to make your further choices about items and rolls optimal,    - You have a lot of gold to spend at 3-3, and you would almost always finish either your core pieces and/or several support pieces of your build,    - You have the flexibility to pick the items you need because of your low hp,    - You scale instantly at 3-3, and most of the time go for win streak from there,    - You know what you're going for so you can roll fast and make good choices along the way 3. **Learn 2-3 builds that work in current meta and fit your playstyle**   I would advise against playing 1 % flexible and going for whatever games gives you. One early ASol is useless if you don't already have Ahri 2 to carry your mid-game AND optimal sorc items. You would die with 2 ASols 1 on the bench if you rush it too quickly.    It's hard to \"discover\" strong builds by yourself, as you only have very limited data from your own games. Instead, check some high-elo streamer VOD on twitch and make screens of several end-game summary tables. Now analyze all top4 builds and check the ones that fit you the most. Personally, as I said before, I would recommend something that relies on strong 3-cost carry (Rengar, Kennen, Gangplank, Aatrox), optimally it's not a S-tier build everyone is going for, and maybe even have some decent \"how-to\" guide somewhere (if you're lucky).   For the current meta, I would recommend: Assasin/Brawler, Sorc/Brawler, Rangers + Aatrox/Sej 4. **It's not about the idea, it's about the execution**   People seem to go crazy about the builds. Sure you can't play whatever, but you also need to understand that the execution of the build is not only about finding optimal items and champions. It's absolutely vital to know how to adjust your build based on what you've got and know all the replacement champions and items you can use to make it stronger at any phase of the game. That's said it's also important to be patient and wait for optimal build for late-game. You would never get all optimal pieces in the mid-game but you would almost always get them all before the late-game.  **Brawler/Assasins build**  I would try to explain the best I can how I play the Brawlers/Assasins build which carried me to Challenger. As I said earlier it's heavily influenced by Dark Hydra, with some tweaks made along the way.  **Core pieces:** Rengar, Pyke, Kha'zix, Rek'sai, Cho'gath, Vi, Warwick   [**    (Kha'zix at the other side so assassins won't get stuck after jumping)  **Flex pieces:**  * Zed 2 (holding items until you get Rengar 2) * Blitzcrank 2   Volibear 2 (holding place for Cho'gath) * Evelynn 2 (good for lvl 6 at 4th assassin or instead of Kha'zix before Cho'gath or as a temporary carry if you can't hit Zed 2 and Rengar 2) * Jinx 1 or other hextech at lvl8 * Sej 2 or Gnar 2 (sometimes useful at lvl 8 if hextech isn't that useful vs other players)  **Core items:**  * GA (THE MOST IMPORTANT item for Rengar, and very good for Cho'gath) * BT (for Rengar, you can use Dragon Claw instead) * Morello (for Pyke or Cho) * Tear (for Pyke, can combine into any tear item, preferably Frozen Heart) * RFC (very solid item on Rengar) * IE (if you're made of BF swords) * Zeke's (that's solid item in theory, but you rarely have spare BF swords, take it from the carousel if you can though)  **Early game**   You're going to be ecoing here and be rather weak compared to other players.  1. Carousel: BF   Vest    Bow/Belt/Rod   Tear/Cloak   Spatula 2. DON'T combine any of the vital parts into non-vital items (your first belt and rod are for morello, but if you get second ones you can use it as you wish) 3. Combine any core items as soon as you can (again... GA is the most important!) and give it to one of flex champions. 4. Eco hard until Krugs. Level to 5. at Krugs. Level to 6. and roll at Stage 3-3 5. Pick all of: Zed, Pyke, Khazix, Rengar, Warwick, Blitz, Vi, Reksai along the way 6. Overall try to build optimal comp in the early game without sacrificing your income (don't keep Elise pair if you can instead got +1 gold)   What works:    - Assasin  t (Khazix, Pyke, Zed) -  best one in my opinion, as it helps you kill some  s along the way and mitigate a lot of dmg while keeping your lose streak    - Void + Brawler  t (Khazix, Kassadin, Reksai, WW or Blitz) -  really solid overall, again you have a lot of true dmg which helps to kill some  s even if you lose    - Nobles + Knights -  this just always works well in the early game (don't take the noble bait though)    - 4 Brawlers if you can get them    - 2 Brawlers + something or 2 Knights + something (most likely, kind of whatever  t)   Early game is a lottery so just try to find something that works well enough. 7. At 3-3 you're looking for your core pieces + Zed, Evelynn and Brawlers (Voli is weak but sometimes worth taking if you can 2-  him). Roll down until you are strong enough to go through midgame (most likely Zed 2 + another Assassin at 2 + 2  * Brawler 2). Rengar 2 AND Cho'gath is amazing to get, but won't happen too often at this stage.   DON'T TAKE JINX. It's your 8. lvl piece and she's here only for hextech anyway.  **Midgame**   You should be strongest here, and win most of your rounds if not all.  1. 6. lvl optimal comp (this will just not happen at lvl 6):    - 3 Assassin's + 3 Brawlers + Voids    -   2. More likely comps at 6. lvl    - 3 Assassin's + 3 Brawlers    - 4 Assassin's + 2 Brawlers (rarely)    - 3 Assassin's + 2 Brawlers + Kassadin    - Always choose 2-  over 1-  (Cho'gath is the exception) 3. Zed 2 is your carry and item holder (Eve 2 can be too if you get her before Zed 2), replace him with Rengar 2 when you get him. 4. 1 round after Wolves level to 7. and roll down to 0 most likely:    - You should hit Rengar 2 here and/or Cho'gath - if you don't just roll further each round    - You're playing 3 Assassins + 4 Brawlers from this point on 5. Cho'gath 1 is enough and reasonable, don't expect Cho'gath 2 anywhere here. It's not worth ruining your eco to roll for him.  **Lategame**   Your comp would lose his strength here. This should be enough for top 3-4 finish. If you   top 1-2 you need to hit your core pieces early and be able to eco hard. I was able to do it in around 40% of my games, which I consider rather high.  1. At Raptors you level to 8. and put hextech in (Jinx is optimal, but don't get crazy over her). 2. If you got eco use it to push Rengar 3, Cho'gath 2, Jinx 2 and maybe even lvl 9 (you can add some strong 2-    here like Gnar, Sejuani or a legendary piece). 3. Your position is pretty straight-forward, you can of course mirror it if people are baiting your Assassin's with a lone  . Check For Zephyr's and don't let your Rengar jump into enemy Morgana or Kennen (Pyke is very welcome though as he casts his ulti very fast).  That's it from me! I hope someone would find it useful.

A neat little trick if you forgot to sell champs before going to the carousel so you can get that extra +1 interest gold.  Also, something I've noticed is that when you actually claim a champ from the carousel(when you run into it), they appear on your bench. You can sell this champion before the next round  ts to possibly bring you up into the next interest interval of 10 gold because income is processed at the  t of the round, in this case, after the entire carousel has been finished.

{"title": "TFT Builds to Diamond EUW - Comps I've used and things I've learned", "author": "albaniax", "selftext": "**I buy the first few rounds champs and then  t eco**  I try to get any 2 * (except Elise) or 3 x Noble. I keep my options open to see what the game is giving me.   Round 2-6 I lvl up and  t eco.     **Keeping Nobles (or another 2nd comp) as Plan B**    Currently I almost always pick Nobles if I see them early. If you see later you are missing only 2-3 and suddenly you get Kayle, you can force them. Had plenty of comebacks by loosing early and then finishing 1-3rd in the end because of Nobles comeback. So I go from like Demons/Rangers to Nobles.  Other times I keep e.g. Demons and Elementals or Shapeshifters/Sorcs, like 2 sets of late-game builds and go with whatever I can build first.

I think I would have skipped even 2 * Kayle and kept them alone :D Double attack-speed from Ragebuild, as it caps.       **I don't force comps who are overused (well, except Nobles sometimes)**  E.g. I haven't played Void/Brawler in a while.  Yes they are OP, but I've seen 4, 5 or sometimes even 6 people going after them. That was reason alone to just skip any Void/Brawler and get other non-contested champs to have mid-game eco advantage.  Anyway here's an example Void/Brawler/Sorc late-game comp with dmg charts - perfect items on Draven, Classic Sorc Cho   Phanton Dancer on VI - was a high roll for sure:          **I use strong early/mid games champs and sell later**   You probably know of Lucian + Ludens. Ahri + Ludens works too.   Others include Zed   Eve (Zed/Eve even 1 * early rounds is good. You can put your late-game items on them so that you can sell them later. When I get one of them 2 *, I sell the other 1 *. You can sell both when late-game  ts)  GangPlank or Aatrox ( t to shine LVL 2)  Kennen I find to squishy without items and/or Yordle.  Gnar is contested but very strong right now.      **I combine early items if they are good, otherwise I wait and just use single-items**       **If I put items early on e.g. Lucian/ Vayne/Garen.., I often try to build another to free items OR get 3 ***  As you need Lucian for Noble, this way you could put the items later on Yas/Swain/Draven/Jinx, etc. who will do much more dmg with it to win you the game. You could also transition to 3 * and keep items.  Here's a 3 * Lucian DMG Chart - 6k damage - 1st place:         Another example:  Let's say you get a Tristana 3 *, you could transition to 4x Gunslingers and let them carry you.   2 * Miss Fortune + Seraphs is also not to be underestimated, she can win you many games and not many people use her.   In this example I combined them with 4 Brawlers to have a tanky frontline.   I think I went from 6th position with 9 hp to final 2nd or 3rd place:           **Early 4 Knights + 1/2 Carry**  It's not a game winner, but tanky enough to not loose much health to stall so that you can eco. Later you can sell 2 and transition to your final build. 1 * Knights are early fine just to get 4.  Sejuani and Poppy are very good tanks, Seju even OP I would say. Scout others so that Seju position can stun well.      **Jinx/Draven with items + whatever**  Didn't try it in todays patch yet but used it very often before. They were/are to OP if you roll their items.  Example:    Void / Brawler / Blademaster / Hextech / Gunslinger / Ninja with Jinx as Blademaster.    Finished 3rd by staying 6 HP a long time, I didn't get my Cho 2 * after 1  rounds.      **Scout tierlists,** /r/CompetitiveTFT**, and Youtube to get latest comps/items**  Learn from the best - self-explanatory.      **Diamond Proof**  Took me 190 games which is average I guess.    ted try-harding the 2nd half of games:          Any further tips, let me know", "id": "cu4j0h", "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1566511784}, 
{"title": "Korean rangers meta build Challenger guide!", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "Hey guys,  I'm back with a new guide on a build that has been used for the past few weeks on the KR server. It has remained as the most popular build on the Korean server during this entire time even while Nobles and Brawlers got buffed. You can see Korean top streamers such as Jinsoo or Portialyn using this consistently and if they don't surely another Korean player is. So this is a build that has been proven to work at the highest levels of challenger in the entire world.       For some reason NA and EU have not been playing rangers much at all in 9.16 so far and have been writing them off, all the while this has remained the most popular build in Korea. With the changes in 9.16b where nobles and brawlers got slightly nerfed, I can see demons and/or elemental builds becoming more prevalent in the meta. And with all that, I believe this build will become one of the strongest, I'd be surprised if I didn't see more people in EUW or NA  t to pick up rangers again.      Let's get into the guide.  Firstly here is the youtube video I made that will go into more details that may not be in the written version:         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **The idea behind the comp:**  When most people think about rangers, they think about attack speed and attack damage carries. This is NOT the focus of this build. This build revolves around the phantom synergy, along with AOE and splash damage from your  s and items.      This is the level 7 comp that you are aiming for:        The idea is to  t the fight off by insta killing one of the enemy  s. Phantom brings them down to critical health, and then with Statikk Shiv and/or Ionic Spark, that is enough splash damage to finish them off.     After the initial kill, you got your frontline protecting your rangers, while Aatrox and Sejuani deal AOE damage and crowd control. And then there is even more AOE and splash damage from the Statikk Shiv and Ionic spark that the entire enemy team gets whittled down.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Early to mid game:**  Standard, build a strong team.  Things you   to look for when deciding to go into this comp:  Usually  ts from some kind of a knights opener.  Ideally you get early mordekaiser and Vayne upgrades since they will be core pieces.  If you get Varus + Aatrox early, then this is a huge good sign for this comp as they got demon synergy together and you can use these two to carry you through the early to midgame.  Ashe + Braum can be used early game also to get glacial buff early on, and pair Ashe with another ranger usually.  Finally if you get early Kindred, that is just amazing since you can get Phantom buff early and the earlier you can get phantom buff the more valuable it is. Removing 1/5  s is bigger than removing 1/9  s.       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Itemization:**  As usual find  s early to use these items unless you can place them on core  s already.      Guardians Angel: Core item on Sejuani, also very good on Aatrox but not mandatory  Morellos: Core item on Sejuani, can also be on Aatrox or Varus later, but not necessary  Statikk Shiv: Only one is needed but more is better. Ashe uses it best, but if no early ashe but you do have early Varus, can put one Statikk Shiv onto Varus earlygame to help the early game.  Ionic Spark: Only build if you know if you are committing to this comp or you get it very early game. Great synergy with Phantom. (Not even necessary to build this, but it is really nice with this build)      That's it for the core items.  Many other items are \"good\". I suggest you watch the video to get an idea of what are other good items to use.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Level 7 full build:**     Tips:   - Put AS items on Ashe (Statikk Shiv, Guinsoos, RFC, Shojins). Statikk Shiv is best,   - Put utility + AP/mana items on Varus. Ionic Spark + Red buff are good   - No items on Kindred because of hextech, she goes in between Varus and Ashe   - No items on Vayne as she will basically be bait for Blitzcrank/Vi   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Gaining power at level 8:**  The full build is online at level 7 but there is quite a few ways to increase our power at level 8.  One of the main ways is to use a Spatula to make a 4 of a kind synergy.      Knights Vow for 4 knights (really good since it gives extra tankiness and frontline, which is very important for rangers):     Tips:    - Knights Vow on Aatrox, use Poppy 2 preferably. Only use Kayle if Kayle 2.      Frozen Mallet for 4 glacials:     Tips:   - Frozen Mallet on Varus, use Braum if   more frontline, Anivia if you got enough frontline and   to hurt backline carries more      Darkin for 4 demons:     Tips:   - Darkin on Ashe, also works well on Kindred, but hard to position now with Hextech. 4th demon is usually Swain or Morgana.      If you do not have a spatula. Then one of the most common things to do, is to find Karthus:     Tips:   - Karthus 1   Mordekaiser   - Put in Poppy to keep knights synergy. Unless you find Kayle 2. But Poppy 2   Kayle 1   - 2 knights synergy is not so good lategame. You can honestly not use a second knight and find any other 2 * legendary such as Yasuo or Swain and put them in over Poppy. But important to 2 * them, otherwise Poppy 2 still better.       ------------------------------------------------  If you really cannot find Sejuani, then you can put in guardians at level 7 and try find Sejuani at level 8. This is the more standard build that has been more popular in EU and NA. But this is not the build that Koreans prefer.          ---------------------------------------------------------------------      Thanks for reading/watching.

{"title": "The Void Game Tree Challenger Guide", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "After the great support from my last guide on the 6 nobles comp guide (  , I made another guide. This time not just on one build but rather on a full game tree. I   to delve into the full Void Game tree.  In this written guide I go over some of the basics and overview, but if you   to know the full thought process and everything behind the images, I suggest you watch the 4 videos I made, split into 4 parts. They should cover everything you need for this game tree segment of TFT.  The videos may be a bit slow to watch and in total are around an hour long (over 4 separate videos), so I included timestamps in the description and you can hop from video to video for whatever you are interested in. Here is the full playlist:    I'm sorry I tend to take too long in describing little things and repeat myself to get the point accross.  Video 1: Introduction to Void game tree, ideas behind the endgame builds, and earlygame openers and itemization:    Video 2: Hypercarry builds with Draven or Jinx:    Video 3: Assassin builds focussing on Rengar or ninjas:    Video 4: Sorcerors:    I didn't make a video on other variations such as elementals since they are not so meta with the void tree right now.       ---------------------------------  **Introduction to the Void Game tree**:    The Void game tree is one of the most diverse, where you can end up going into several directions in the endgame. Openers generally  t with some combination of void or brawlers. Later in the game you shift into either Sorcerors (the most popular), or an assassin variation (usually with Rengar), or a hypercarry variation (usually with Jinx).      Because of its versatility, and the amount of options it makes the Void Tree one of the most powerful in the game as ChoGath and Brawlers in general are still in a great spot right now. I suggest you watch the video if you   to have an idea of the openers and early itemization because it would require too many pictures here and I   to keep the written guide a bit more concise.       **Itemization:**  Many items can be used in all endgame variations. Prioritize building these items early that can switch from build to build early. Find somebody who uses the items well in early game, and either keep them if they are part of your core lategame comp, or replace the  s later once you find the  s you   lategame.  RFC - Will end up on Draven or Jinx (hypercarries), Zed or Rengar (assassins), Aurelion Sol (sorcs)  Morellos - Will end up on Vi and Chogath (all builds), Ahri or Karthus (sorcs)  Ludens Echo - Will end up on Khazix, Akali or Evelynn (assassins, but Khazix can be in hypercarry comp), can also put on ChoGath but not optimal (for all comps), Karthus, Ahri, Asol (sorcs)  GA - Will end up on Chogath and Vi (all builds), or later maybe Swain or Kennen   Statikk Shiv - This item is not ideal for assassins or hypercarries now, but it will do as a substitute, otherwise it mostly fits in sorc comps on Ahri/ASol/TF  Those are the main items you can build early that fit into all builds, if you build other items then you are usually looking to pivot into one of the specific endgame variations.      **The endgame possibilities:**  I'll briefly describe the ideas and main carry options here, I go into the specific builds later.  Hypercarry build with Jinx or Draven - Create a beefy frontline with brawlers while your carries get time to ramp up and kill everyone. I prefer the variation with Jinx here since she synergizes so well with Vi for Hextech, who also synergizes very well with Blitzcrank. This variation scale very well into the lategame unlike assassins, that has a huge midgame powerspike then flattens out.      Assassin build - Usually with Rengar. The items here are going to be similar to hypercarry build, so actually something that I have seen high ELO Korean streamers such as Jinsoo or Portyalin do is they will go with Assassins early and then transition into a hypercarry build later. This does have a very big midgame powerspike though and does a good job of getting top 4. A new variation that is appearing with the Zed and Ninja buffs are doing 3 void, 4 ninjas, which I talk briefly about later.      Sorcs - The most common void variation now, that most people in the West use currently. However the other 2 are getting more popular fast. Basically you   to end up getting ASol 2 as your carry nowadays to one shot enemy squishies.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Part 2: Hypercarries:    Void + 4 Brawlers + Jinx +GP/MF, can be 6 brawlers at 8 and 6 brawlers + void at 9 or some variation of this.   Level 7 minimum required  Level 7 example with GP + void:    Level 8 example 6 brawlers no void:    Level 9 example with 6 brawlers + void + MF2:    tips:   * Go with this when you find Jinx 2 before Draven 2 * Try get Jinx 2 before levelling to 8 unless very healthy and nobody else  s jinx (rare) * Put Morellos + GA on Cho or Vi, usually Vi now, since you get her earlier * Pick up GP earlygame if intending to go into hypercarry tree. Keep GP until MF 2, can put GP items onto MF * early item holder for AD items can be kassadin/zed/rengar/varus * I like to have void in the lategame vs nobles teams since void helps with true damage, but otherwise I prefer to have brawlers for a beefy frontline      Void + 4 brawlers + Draven + 3 blademasters + imperial  Level 7 minimum required, but get Draven 2 on 7  Level 7 example with 2 imperial:    Level 8 example with 3 blademasters:    Level 9 example with 3 blademasters 2 imperial:    tips:   * Go with this when you find Draven 2 before Jinx 2 * Try to get Draven 2 before levelling to 8 unless very healthy and nobody else  s Draven * Put Morellos + GA on Vi preferably, we   to transfer her items to Swain later at level 9 * Can transfer GP items onto Yasuo 2 at level 9 * early item holder for AD items can be kassadin/zed/rengar/varus * This variation has less flexibility than Jinx variation where you can do a bunch of different things at levels 7-9 as shown       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Part 3: Assassins       Void + assassins.Rengar carry level 7 required:    * Rengar is your hardcarry, save up items for him. RFC, BT, GA is agreed upon best item combo. * Akali can be changed for Evelynn or Pyke (Evelynn and Akali very close, Pyke feels a bit worse now after nerfs) * No need to level to 8, just try to 3   your carries (Rengar, Eve, Akali, Khazix, Vi,, etc) * If you level to 8, just add some legendary or big tank (sej/Gnar). You can also add Jinx for hextech * Earlygame, Put AP items on Ahri/TF/Lucian, Khazix if saving another Kha on bench to replace. * Earlygame, Put AD items on kassadin/zed/rengar/varus, etc usually * This is a good build to go into when you   to go Draven or Jinx carry, but cannot find Draven or Jinx. Can later transfer into Draven or Jinx build anyways. Just make sure to 2 * your hypercarry and build into it. Hypercarries scale better into lategame and this is one of the transition options in lategame (Rengar and Zed use similar items to Jinx or Draven). * Top 4 build, hard to top 1 without transitioning. Still feels very good up til very lategame  4 ninjas:    tips:  * If you get many Zeds can can maybe 3 * him, and pick up a lot of ninjas, this variations may be better. * No need to level to 8, just try to 3   your carries (Zed, Rengar, Akali, Shen, Kennen, etc) * If you level to 8, just add some legendary or big tank (sej/Gnar) * Put AP items on Ahri/TF/Lucian, Khazix if saving another Kha on bench to replace. * Put AD items on kassadin/zed/rengar/varus, etc usually * This is a good build to go into when you   to go Draven or Jinx carry, but cannot find Draven or Jinx. Can later transfer into Draven or Jinx build anyways. Just make sure to 2 * your hypercarry and build into it. Hypercarries scale better into lategame and this is one of the transition options in lategame (Rengar and Zed use similar items to Jinx or Draven). * Top 4 build, hard to top 1 without transitioning. Still feels very good without transitioning up til very lategame   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Part 4: Sorcerors     Level 7 minimum required:    Level 8 example with Asol and legendary:    Level 8 example with Asol + shapeshifter:    Level 8 example with 6 sorcerors:    tips:  * Very important to be getting Aurelion Sol later. Do not intend to keep TF/Lulu until lategame. * Put Asol items on TF or Lulu/Veigar, bring in Asol once you 2 * him (but make sure to 2 * him first) * At level 8, can make a few small transitions to significantly strengthen squad. Most common transitions are listed above.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thank you for reading/watching.

{"title": "A few tips from a Challenger player", "author": "GreatOldOne521", "selftext": "Hi everyone!  A few days ago I've reached Challenger on EUW ([proof]  and [lolchess]  and a friend asked me for some tips to climb. I've sent him some general tips that helped me along the way (which aren't the usual  play meta comps  tips) and apparently he found them useful as it helped him reach Plat after being stuck in gold for awhile. I thought maybe other people will find it useful as well so here they are:  1. **Scout with purpose, but don't scout too much**. This one is a bit weird, but hear me out. If you ask people if scouting is important in this game, they will tell you yes, but a lot of the times won't be able to explain why. Just going through people's boards randomly without purpose is useless since you will just forget everything after a few seconds and won't gain any helpful information. When you do scout, you have to have a purpose behind it. Think of the information you   to gather before scouting and look for that specific information while doing it. Here are a few good examples:  * Blitzcrank - look for enemy Blitzcranks so you'll know if you need to position differently to protect your carries. Things that you need to ask yourself: is someone playing Blitzcrank? which side is it on? This will help you learn if you need to put a bait   on the left, right or both sides of the board. * Hextech - this one is pretty easy, if someone is playing Hextechs, separate your item carrying  s. I (sometimes) even like to throw a random unbuilt item on some   that I don't mind getting hexteched. * Healing items/champions - is someone running a Swain/BT Draven/Warmog's Shyv/etc'? Make sure you have a way to deal with it. Red Buff or Morellos are usually the items you're looking for. * Specific champions - looking to get that 2 * Cho completed? Make sure there aren't 3 other people who already have 2 * Cho on their board. Your chances of hitting it will be way too low and most of the time you'll reroll 40g without finding what you need.  So whenever scouting, make a mental list of the things you need to check and check specifically for them. This seems obvious when you think about it, but most people don't actually gather the right information or don't use the gathered information correctly.  In addition, you don't   to be too fixated on scouting (this is the  don't scout too much part ). I had a period of time while climbing to Masters where I've dropped from D2 to D4 in a matter of 1-2 days. I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong and it took me a while to figure it out. I've noticed that I was doing really well early but I was losing almost all of my HP sometime in the mid-game. It was right after I  ted seeing streamers  ting to scout a lot and I tried to imitate them. Not only did I not follow the above rules, I also hurt myself by giving too much weight to what I saw other people do.  What happened was, I was scouting every 1-2 fights and looked at everyone's comps. If I was going Void/Brawlers early and I saw 4 other people going for it, I immediately dropped my comp and tried to pivot to something else. Later in the game, I suddenly saw that 2 other people dropped it as well and I was stuck with some useless  s that I could hardly 2 * and didn't synergize at all. Not only that, I also spent so much time scouting, that I didn't have time to think about my own comp and plan for the future. Once I've stopped doing that, I saw an immediate improvement in my play and I climbed back up.  2. **Focus on yourself (mind the  s you roll over)**. I've touched a bit on this in my previous point, but I think this deserves its own section. It's true that going the same comp as 5 other people isn't usually a good idea, but if you have an open mind and focus on what *your* options are, you can sometimes find pathways that you would otherwise miss. I'll give an example:   You're rolling for that Kayle to complete your noble comp but notice that you see a lot of open Aatroxes, GPs, Dravens in your store. A quick scout shows that BMs are completely open this game and you already have that Fiora 2 * and Lucian 2 * from your noble comp. What is that? You have an RFC you've been saving for a Jinx that you couldn't find? Maybe it's time to  t buying some BMs while you roll. Maybe you find your Kayle and and go nobles anyway. But maybe you can transition into BMs and get that top 4 instead of finishing 6th.   You have no idea how many times this carried me from a potential 7-8th place to top 3-4. Especially in high elo, this can save you a TON of LP.  3. **Mind your health**. I feel like this is a very well known tip, but it's so important that I   to mention it shortly anyway. Did you just lose 30 hp in 2 fights? Is your comp a bunch of 1 *  s and it seems like everyone in the lobby is stronger than you? Don't greed for that 40g interest before you level up to 6! Just spend your gold! Saving another 30 hp in exchange for losing some interest is well worth it. Yes, you probably won't finish 1st if you do that, but at least you won't finish 8th.  That's it, sorry for the long read, but I hope this at least helped some people. If you have any questions then feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer when I have the time (it's work hours atm so it might take a while).  **tl;dr**  - Know when and how to scout, focus on yourself and your options, don't greed for interest when you're losing a lot of health.", "id": "cryrdz", "num_comments": 63, "created_utc": 1566117207}, 
{"title": "Challenger guide on 6 nobles + Transitions and pivots", "author": "SlCKXpT", "selftext": "Hey guys,  I know there has already been an excellent guide on this, and a lot of this may have already been mentioned but I have a few extra things to add and I also made a video version of the guide where I go into more details. Here is the video where I have timestamps in the description:         Nobles is still the strongest team comp in the game right now. Void/brawlers + sorc or + jinx carry may be able to beat it until a certain point, but tbh in the lategame, a stacked nobles team still will not lose to anyone.        **Knights/Nobles Tree:**     * When you go into this tree you   to end up with 6 nobles, but you will only find Kayle about 1/3 of the time it is important to know how to transition out to get top 4. * If you find Kayle and get 6 nobles, you can usually top 1 unless vs another 6 nobles player who highrolled more * Opener is generally going to be nobles and/or knights   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      **Openers:**  Knights  t or nobles  t is best. Put out your strongest team and pick up any nobles on the way. At level 7 roll to find Kayle and either one of Jinx or Draven. If you cannot find Kayle you need to know how to pivot properlly.  Pick up knights as well. Field strongest team, but keep nobles on bench even if not playing them. No need to 3 * nobles.  Standard levelling in general, just try have a strong early-midgame.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **Items:**  You   items for your future carries (Draven or Jinx).  Pick 3 out of the following 6: RFC, IE, BT, Guinsoos, Runaans, Red buff.  Personally my favorite combo is RFC + IE + BT, but as long as you got 3 out of the 6 and one of them is either RFC or guinsoos it will be fine.  Preferably get some items on GP as well. Red buff or Morellos (not both) + GA on him and he will be an amazing secondary carry throughout the game that can hit the backline with his ult.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      \"**Final\" Builds**  6 nobles + Jinx Level 7 required:    Add MF or GP for gunslingers on Level 8:    6 nobles + Blademasters (with Draven usually):Level 8 required:    Tips:  * Quite straightforward comp relies a lot on hitting Kayle * GP is OP and fits into both comps, try to pick him up always * Keep nobles on bench until Level 7 and you have made a full transition into another comp pretty much * Pick up knights and use knights to help you through early - midgame, you will keep them if you cannot find Kayle * If you get the 6 nobles, you can eco to level 8 easily usually and then build OP game winning team from there.      **When you cannot find Kayle, you need to pivot into your backup, which is why you have been picking up knights the whole time. Knights also help to have a strong early - midgame until you find Kayle.**  **Let us  t with Jinx comps:**  4 knights + Jinx Level 7 required to add Kindred for Phantom:    Level 8 can get 4 gunslingers 4 knights:    or go 4 gunslingers + 2 knights + 2 guardians:    Tips:   * guardians vs heavy physical damage, knights vs magic damage * Try to get Jinx 2 before levelling to 8 unless very healthy and nobody else  s Draven * Level 7 comp is usually just temporary to help you to level 8      **Blademaster comps**  4 knights + 3 blademasters Level 7 required:    Level 8 can add Kindred for Phantom:    or go with 4 imperials + 2 knights + 3 BM:    or go with 2 knights + 2 guardians + 2 imperials:    Tips:  * Can sell GP to put items onto Yasuo * I find 4 imperials generally strongest version overall, on par with nobles. * Otherwise I like to use guardians vs lots of physical damage, and Phantom/4 knights vs magic damage. * Try to get Draven 2 before levelling to 8 unless very healthy and nobody else  s Draven      Emergency blademasters when cannot find Draven not Jinx, use Aatrox, Shen, GP.           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here is the video where I have timestamps in the description:     I'll try to answer all questions here.

{"title": "My take on Legendary  s in the Early Game [Challenger]", "author": "TehMeeperz", "selftext": "I very recently found out the hard way mid-tournament that hoarding legionaries isn't a good strategy regardless of whether they fit in to your comp. Many of you may have already experienced this, but if not then here is a run down of what to do with which legendary at which given point.       Swain: Sorcerer/Elementalist, Void/Sorcerer, Imperial/Blademaster, Guardian/Blademaster   Swain is an incredibly powerful   however I will only put him in/replace a carry under very specific variables.  The most common situation where a Swain 1 can easily carry your game is with a GA and a Morello; in an Elementalist/Sorc build I will always replace my Kennen carry given I still have a strong CC   (sej, cho, etc) as he dishes out insane damage. Many say that the current morello meta hits him hard, however due to a (potential) bug Swain benefits from this with GA, as he can heal when he is \"dead\" as to return back to full HP upon popping from Morello.   In regard to imperials swain is fine to put in tier 1, granted you at least have a Kat 2 to make the Imperial buff truly worth it with you Darius/Draven.   As for a Guardian/Blademaster game I am happy to replace Darius 2 with Swain 1 granted he has a single morello, however a GA is still a high requirement.      Yasuo: Blademaster, Gunslinger/Blademaster  Yasuo as a tier 1 legendary is very easy to slap on the board as a filler   to win early-mid games. I cannot stress enough how important it is to replace him late game (unless you've kitted him out with on-hit items). In comparison to the other available blade masters when running only three, getting other core  s to two   will often result in more wins than a Yasuo one (for instance Aatrox, Shen are much better alternatives at two  ). He is exceedingly good early to mid and that is the key to the champion.       Karthus: Sorcerer/Elementalist, Sorcerer, Rangers, Void/Sorcerer   Karthus is an exceedingly good early pick up   as you may know, he should be an instant replacement for most sorcerers. In addition to this, the only other build I would be happy to slap a Karthus 1 down in besides Sorcerers is Rangers, this is due to the easy replacement of a Mordekaiser for phantom buff with Kindred. Keep in mind that in few situations of a 4 knight ranger game, I would take a Mordekaiser two over a Karthus one.       Kayle: Knights, Guardians, Rangers  Kayle was nerfed recently so isn't nearly as powerful as she was before, however she still operates as an above-average   even in tier 1. In most situations the best replacement would be for a Garen 2 as Garen doesn't provide any CC and only operates as a beef (low) damage dealer. This applies to Darius and Mordekaiser granted they arent giving their respective buffs. In regard to other knight replacements, Sejuani 2 is in such a good place right now that a Kayle 1 is vastly inferior, same applies for a Poppy 2. In situations where I only have a Poppy 1 or a Sejuani 1 they are replaceable however I will still hold them on my bench to attempt to get the tier 2 variant. When putting a Kayle in to play keep in mind although she's a Knight she's very squishy and operates much as a ranger would, keep this in mind when replacing core front liners in the early game as it could leave a ranger build very open to attacks.      Anivia: Sorcerer/Elementalists, Void/Sorcerer   Anivia is an extremely useful pick up in the early game, and can maintain her usefulness well in to the late game granted there are ranger/draven comps in your game that you need to counter. As a result I will happily throw an Anivia in to most compositions. The obvious replacement   for her is of course a Lissandra, even if it's a Lissandra tier two (or tier three for that regard) the replacement is obvious. Keep in mind that by removing a Lissandra you're leaving your front line weaker though and a Sejuani would be a good beefy   that works with glacial.   Many people believe the combination of Lissandra/Anivia + Kennen or Brand is the best option as it provides 2 glacial, but it's important to keep in mind that Brand does some serious damage even at 1 and provides Demon buff which is arguably better than glacial 2 in which one of the holders is a sacrificial  , and Kennen is an extremely good   all around due to his AoE CC.       Well, that's all of the legendary  s.      Fine.      Miss Fortune: Gunslinger, Sorcerer  Miss fortune is only worth putting in when she is tier 2 as most  s are much better than her, she can also operate well in a Sorcerer comp due to her AoE ultimate however there are many better alternatives.", "id": "cpy2j3", "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1565724589}, 
{"title": "NA Challenger Detailed Guide for Climbing | Playing from behind", "author": "AlanLube", "selftext": "Last week I made a video with a few quick tips in general for climbing and forcing comps. I   to give more tips on small decisions people can make rather than the usual build guides that everyone has seen.  Decent amount of people found that helpful so I spent the last week or so thinking about this next topic which I personally find much harder and am sure many people do as well. Video link for those who   to eat and relax or multi-task etc, with gameplay.    **Forcing Comps with less health**  Playing from behind when you just can't seem to find the right  s or combine the right items is much harder than having a healthy win streak and forcing a meta comp. Not only do you feel down because your luck is garbage that game, but you  t losing health fast. Note this is just a barebones skeleton of my playstyle of course it will deviate in certain situations.  **1) Keep up to level 6**   Like most players who level after Krugs and roll to find a balanced midgame comp. I also suggest that after Krugs to do the same. Leveling to 6 will increase the chance you find 4   5 cost  s that can turn your luck around at this point. Econ'ing for more gold this early is a little greedier than I personally recommend since leveling early helps you find those  s you will need to transition + all in. Plus sometimes you will get lucky and find a strong midgame comp right after krugs and stabilize.  **2) If still unlucky, Econ**   If the game decides to keep giving you nothing this is where it gets much harder. Hopefully at this point you've been losing, but not by too much. This point in the game is where the tough decision is made. You don't have to stick to a certain comp and sell everything else to make money, but I suggest you keep your options down to 2 meta comps and mainly keeping the main carries/ s. If you need to make money at any point in stage 3, sell that extra rek'sai or vayne. Making money now is crucial since after wolves you will all in once again and having more money + lose streak money should help find that last ashe or kennen you might need.  **3) After 3-4 Carousel, Commit:**   After the carosel of stage 3 (two more rounds until wolves) you should at this point nearly decide what comp you plan to go. A bit of luck will be required but this goes for any match behind or not. At this point you should take a look at your items and see what you can possibly build toward. This should help in deciding what comp you plan to force. If you found an ashe + kindred or a cho + rek'sai along the way the decision should be much easier. At this point flexibility should not matter anymore. Try to figure out how much health you will lose in the next 2 rounds. If you believe you can stay around 30 health, DO NOT ROLL YET. Save up that income. This comes at a large risk but also is a case by case call. Sell off the  s you won't need to net that extra 2-3 gold after wolves.  **4) All in**   After wolves. ALL IN HARD. Be fast. At this point you should have around 40 gold depending how many  s you found or not. The closer you are the better. Level to 7, this may be off curve but many players with healthy economies will also level at this point and fighting someone who leveled while you didn't is not worth the extra round of gold. You should have given up earlier rounds while people were weaker to make money. It's too late at this point.  **5) Don't overcommit**   At this point hopefully you have found a solid 7   team comp. You might be missing that last cho or that last kindred, but I advise you wait. If you can save 10 or even 20 gold while going into the first fight. See how the fight goes. Is your team strong enough? Did you somehow beat the #1 guy? Did you lose to last place? All these questions will help you decide what to do in the coming rounds. Hopefully, you find yourself winning hard or just barely losing to the strongest guy. Dont roll your last 10-15 gold for that last cho or kindred. It is unlikely at this point you will find it and only bury yourself into a grave. If you still lose hard or didn't finish your comp then you should roll and pray.  **6) Late Stage 4**   Hopefully at this point you were able to survive until carosel. If you are low health you should have a decent mid pick at the carosel. At this stage pick whatever you need most. A rod for the morello? sure. That last Cho gath you need? sure. It's case by case but identify what you need to survive the next two rounds after raptors. Even if you have lost a round or two in stage four, hopefully they were close and you can stay around 20+ health. If you can win the first round after carosel. Keep econ'ing. If you can't maybe you should level early or roll down a bit more (BUT NOT TOO MUCH). If you roll down all your gold at this point you almost guarantee you will die after raptors. If you can't find the   you need fast in 2-3 rolls it's a lost cause and you should just pray you fight a ghost at 3-5.  **7) Raptors**   This is the point in the game where it was important that you econ most of stage four. If you kept rolling during the middle rounds and don't have enough money at this point you have basically lost at this point. Leveling to 8 after the raptors and going All in once more will help you win against those who rolled too much and keep up with the players with healthy econ. Putting in that last   that rounds out your comp will be different everytime, but will help immensely. If you are still missing a cho gath or sejuani or kindred at this point it will also increase your chances of finding them after you level. While you may have less gold after leveling the guaranteed extra   will almost always be worth it. Even finding a random yasuo or anivia will help you survive 1 more round.  **8) Endgame**   At this point in the game everything is case by case. If you found a strong team with full upgrades you can possibly econ and level to 9. Maybe you're barely holding on and roll every round to find that last   you need. Whatever the case may be if you made it to this point you should hopefully be able to finish at least 4th place which is the least you can ask for with a bad  t.  **Extra tips**  **Make use of the early  s you found**:    Maybe you were able to find a level 2 mord early but nothing else. Look for rangers possibly. Maybe a level 2 darius? Possibly a draven game so pick up shens or aatrox. Use the cheap  s you found to help decide on what comp to force. It will be cost efficient to keep in and will help round out your team after wolves.  **Make whatever items you can:**    Sometimes the game is an ass and gives you 2 chain vests 2 belts and a negatron cloak.  Make whatever items you can. We all know that the meta items are morello's ga's etc. But sometimes you cant make these. A simple defensive dragon claw + bt on draven can go a long way. I even once went Warmogs, BT, Dragon Claw Draven and that was able to carry me to second place while everyone tried to find cho gath.  **Conclusion:**    Playing from behind creates a lot more tough decisions that you have to make. Sometimes you might find an early draven, but have nothing else that goes with it. Don't be afraid to sell the draven or cho'gath by round 3-4 if you can't envision finding everything else. If you made an early level 2 ahri or varus, try to stick to it. Selling that later will result in -2 gold and finding the other  s to pair with it will be 1 less   to look for. Sometimes you will make the wrong decision. Don't simply curse your luck. Look at the decision you made at what point in the game and ask yourself. Did this decision set me up to be able to comeback? Maybe it did but the luck wasn't there. Maybe it wasn't. Take every game as a learning experience and learn from it instead of just calling next or thinking TFT is too luck based. While TFT has a lot of lucky mechanics that will decide your game, it is your job to minimize that luck and put yourself in the best position to win.", "id": "cpvo4a", "num_comments": 70, "created_utc": 1565714337}, 
{"title": "A barebones guide on how to play keane build in 9.15b, by a random diamond 3 player", "author": "mikeszhang", "selftext": "hello reddit. i don't think i'm very good, but i wrote a guide in a google doc for someone else tonight, and figured i would post it here in case people think it's correct/helpful. i'm open to any criticism, but keep in mind even i don't play like this every game. things in this game can sometimes be situational, but i play this same way in most of my games.   **Item mention:**  Normally you just build items for early game imo, then try to transition to one of the top tier builds that uses those items well. In order I think these items will give you the most strength in a fight: shiv ionic spark morello=GA=ludens. Ludens can go up  if you have a good user like a tier 2 ahri, but typically i think shiv is the best early item. Late game you just slap it on your carry, whether thats a mage that needs ap or an attack speed carry (draven and rangers can use shiv fine). I like ionic spark on whoever has GA, because they will live a long time. Get GA on whoever needs to get their ults off, typically frontline like cho or swain or gnar or something.  **Builds:**  These are what i consider to be the best builds:  Eco Flex: I'll get into this later  Void sorcs: cho, reksai, blitz, ww, ahri, kassadin, karthus/asol (can use morg/lulu/tf/veigar in the meantime). Can also drop ww and blitz to get 6 sorc late if not against assassins (esp if you get yuumi)  Preferred items: morello+GA + flex (yuumi, ionic spark, etc) for cho, shiv/ludens/morellos ahri for early, and mana items on karthus (or your carry) late  4 rangers: ashe, varus, kindred, vayne, sej, morde, flex 2 knights or 2 guardians  Preferred items: shivs on ashe and zekes on kindred. Hurricane is surprisingly good on ashe, and with hurricane demon ashe and cursed blade are good.   2 rangers: ashe, varus + elementals ( brand, liss, kennen (swap for aniv)). 2 guardian or 2 knights (sej for 4 glacial, and maybe morde if you have kindred instead of varus since brand gives varus demon)  Preferred items: shivs on ashe, glacial/shivs/cursed blade on varus (titanic is good if already glacialed), carry items (guinsoos rageblade rfc rabadons etc) on brand  Imperial guardian knights blademaster draven: perfect draven items (rfc bt guinsoos), 4 knights, 2 guardians, draven, blademaster item on someone or 4 imperial in late game.  Void assassins: cho, reksai, blitz, ww, rengar, khazix, flex (akali=pyke zed rest). Not the best build anymore, but workable if you have perfect rengar items and the right  s early (BT RFC GA REQUIRED)    **Playstyle:**  I play like this almost every game. Sometimes if your shop is really good you can ignore one of these, but I do this almost every time. The midgame is quite flexible, but in general prioritize hitting interest thresholds most rounds.  2-1: level up (or level at 2-2 if shop was too good)  2-3: get to 10 gold for 1 interest (or pre-level before carousel if 4-9 gold)  2-4: level if you didn't level yet  2-5: get 2 interest   After krugs: level  Then there are two paths  If you're low or if you're winstreaking and   to play like an aggro monkey: roll after krugs after you hit level 6  Otherwise, wait until near wolves  Three paths this time  Low or   to winstreak, level 2 rounds before wolves and roll  Normal situation: level right after wolves to match enemy spending, optional rolling at 7  You're high rolling like a motherfucker and   to greed a little eco because you think there's no way you lose a fight: level 2 rounds after wolves and dont roll until later  Here's where it's too situational to explain  If you're dying: roll  If you aren't dying: eco and pick up good potential future  s while building bank to push 8  If you're really close to certain upgrades and are likely to upgrade your team: roll until you upgrade some, then stop once it's unrealistic to hit more upgrades to push 8 after  Late game baby  Dying: level 2 rounds before raptors  Not dying: level right after raptors  Roll now that you're level 8, or once you literally hit all your upgrades and completed your team comp and your next  ,  t ecoing to push 9   **Eco Flex: **  This is the playstyle that keane popularized recently. He did not invent it, he copied it from high elo koreans and refined it. You pretty much push level 8 like I described, doing some rolling at the times mentioned if your team isn't strong enough to stay alive. It focuses on using good 3 and 4 cost  s, since your chance of hitting 3 costs stays the same all game, and your chance of hitting 4 cost  s goes up. The upside is that it's incredibly flexible (and thus not prone to low rolling as much), the downside is that it's a bit harder to craft the strongest possible team. That being said, these are the synergies and  s you're looking for (roughly in order)  Synergies:  Special mention: always go void sorcs if you can get a tier 2 cho xd  Sorc 3  Yordle 3  Elemental  Dragon (if magic damage)  Knight 2  Phantom 2  Demon 2   s:  Karthus (best  )  Anivia (best vs rangers, good into most comps esp with elemental)  Swain (decent standalone, and gives demon)(somewhat needs GA)  Kayle (no good until tier 2, even then it's meh)  Yasuo (at this point you're just settling because at least it's not an mf)  Aurelion sol (best, esp if enemies have a lot of magic, because of dragon buff)  Gnar (kinda needs GA, can carry with some good items, best user of  useless  items like warmogs dragonclaw and red buff)  Brand (good as tier 2 even if you don't get elemental buff)  Sej (best vs many rangers)  Cho (even with no synergies cho is good into many rangers. If you play cho, it's best to use kassadin reksai as well though)  Kindred (only for phantom once you have karthus in, and most of the time it's too expensive so you'd rather use morde for knight buff and phantom)  Kennen (best, get morellos and GA on him asap. Dragonclaw good 3rd item, so is ionic spark)  Poppy (real good, and is yordle with kennen)  Morgana (better vs assassins and brawlers, worse vs rangers)  Veigar (no 1    s allowed)  Aatrox (not ideal, still decent vs assassins and good in a pinch)  Shyvana (only putting in late when you need dragon buff for sol)  Tf (great in this comp until you have the premier sorcs like karthus and sol)  Lucian (good standalone if tier 2)  Lulu (yordle and support mage. Not good if already have TF)  Ahri (better if planning to use gnar, because wild. Mostly good in void sorc variant)  Liss (if going elementals)  Reksai (if going void)  It's hard to be more specific about this comp, but it's really just whatever good  s you used early, combined with good transition pieces to round out 3 sorc comp. Typically it has either 3 yordle or 3 elementalist for some frontline, but often will have both. Two examples I'd use (keep in mind these are level 8 comps focused around legendaries):  With cho: Karthus, Asol, Kassadin, Reksai, Cho, Morg, Lulu, TF  Without cho: Karthus, Asol, Morgana, Poppy, Gnar, Kennen, Anivia, Brand  Pretty much you   a mix of frontline and backline, and to fill out as many of the above synergies as possible with the  s listed. It's really flexible, and anything can work if you built up momentum from winstreaking by using your natural rolls efficiently.   that's all. no tl;dr since there are bullet points. this is pretty much a guide on how to play keane build, but again it changes game by game based on if you're high rolling or low rolling. hope you enjoyed, let me know what you think. sorry for bad formatting, posted from my phone", "id": "co1pn7", "num_comments": 127, "created_utc": 1565353818},

Below, I've added the three tables you need in order to decide how much gold you need to spend rerolling to have either a 50%, 75%, or 90% confidence of hitting it. One quick note from my original post- you'll notice I readded the 2 gold back in for every value, because someone in the comments noted that if you already have the champ in the shop, you probably aren't rerolling so the table wouldn't be used. Therefore, the assumption we make is that the champ you are looking for is NOT already in your shop, and this is the amount of gold that you need to spend to find it.  To clarify how to read the table, it's saying for example that at level 7, assuming Gnar is not already in your shop, you need to spend 18 gold to get Gnar 50% of the time, 34 gold to get Gnar 75% of the time, and 56 gold to get Gnar 90% of the time!

{"title": "For people who like to play forced comps, I have a tip! I call it \"substituting.\"", "author": "iycie", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'd like to share a tip I call \"substituting\". I'm definitely not the first person to use this strategy and I'm not sure if there's already a name for it.      Let's say I'm going for a Demon/Ranger comp, with Aatrox and Varus as the main damage carries. While Varus is accessible early in the game, Aatrox does not appear in the shop until level 4, and you need to be level 5 to have a decent chance of getting 3 cost champions in your shop. So, until you can get those Aatroxxes in the shop, you can substitute it with another Demon. Elise is a 1 cost that frequently appears in shops (because no one ever buys her), so you can easily get a level 2 so you can  t being relevant in the early-mid game, and get that Demon bonus.      Another great example is a Void/Brawler comp. Due to Cho'gath and Rek'sai being identical in their traits (They are both Void and Brawler) they are commonly put together in various comps. Cho'gath is a 4 cost champion, of which you cannot buy until level 5 or level 6 for a reasonable chance of getting Cho'gath specifically. If my full comp will consist of Cho'gath, Rek'sai, and Kassadin, I can use a Kha'zix in place of Cho'gath, which allows me to get the void bonus (3 void champions required to let them deal true damage) and stay relevant throughout the early game.      A simpler representation (or TL;DR):      Pros:   + You can get tier 2 champions and tribe bonuses early on.   + If you get the desired hypercarry items early on, you can put them on the \"substitute.\" It is completely safe because when you sell your substitute, the full item will be placed in your inventory and you can immediately put it on your desired carry.   + Putting the carry items on the substitute is also useful in that it provides stats to help you gain the edge of your opponent in early game battles. Many people hold onto their items because they   to save it for a champion that can hypercarry.      Cons debunked:   - You waste money on a champion that won't be part of your final comp. Isn't it better to just save money for economy? False: One of the largest weaknesses of forced comp and lategame strategies is that you lose way too much HP early-mid game. Having access to tribe bonuses early on will help you get through losing less HP. Another thing to note is that 1 cost champions resell for full value at both tier 1 and tier 2. Not that a tier 2 champion is even a big investment (it only costs 3 gold), but you can still resell it for full value whenever you need to.      This post was aimed towards newer players, I am well aware that there are highly experienced players that will inevitable say, \"I already do this\" or \"isn't this what you would just do by instinct?\"", "id": "cn9p0y", "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1565202977}, 
{"title": "Just hit Challenger NA | Midgame Tips   AMA cause why not", "author": "AlanLube", "selftext": "Video Link for those who   a semi-long video along gameplay of the game that got challenger (Karthus Abuse btw)     | Video isn't super polished, first time making a guide like video and didn't have much time to edit and stuff. Hopefully will try to make better content in the future.  I'm not the most amazing player, at this post 127 games with 22.8% winrate. I would make the excuse that I played ranked with friends a lot before seriously climbing but I have learned a few good things I think people don't mention.  **Quick Tips:** After raptors understand that you will likely only have one carousel item to depend on so commit to what you build and build now. Everyone will powerspike and you don't   to be left behind.Don't forget to scout other players when you make top 3. Stealing the 5-cost   that they need at carousel will be crucial in the late game  **1st : Watch High LP Streamers** There are many highly skilled streamers that are challenger but play mostly experimental builds. While I find many of their streams informative to see their decision making, watching the streamers with 5 + LP will give insight on the micro details that give them consistent results over the rest of challenger.  **2nd : I believe forcing meta comps yields the most success in high level ranked** A lot of people constantly make the tip that going what the game gives you will result in better results, and while I agree to a certain extent, I believe that understanding the 3 or so meta comps (Last patch Rangers, Void Sorc, Void Rengar, Draven) will result in better results than going for the demon or shapeshifter build. Being able to force any of the meta compositions will result in easier decision making and better item planning.  **3rd: Make Gold at everywhere possible** A mistake I see a lot of people (including myself at times) is NOT selling  s to make gold. Early game this won't apply since I'll be buying whatever  s come up to win the early rounds. By the time Krugs comes around is when I nearly commit to a build and sell anything that doesn't fit or that won't go in immediately. Even if a   will eventually come into the build I will sell it now as finding it later and netting +1 gold will often be the correct decision. This is also why I usually will not go for level 3  s that aren't super important early. Holding onto 6 Kassadins for your Void Sorc build will sacrifice gold and will not be the deal breaker later in the game. The deal breaker is whether or not you can find Cho or Karthus.  This is why I personally rarely go for braums and leona. Unless I am almost sure I will use these  s I won't buy them as the gold deficit from holding them is too much for me personally.  **Reasoning** By forcing a meta build, I will often be able to make more gold as I can commit and sell  s earlier on. This nets in more gold which results in being more likely to find the  s I need. Even if 1 gold doesn't seem like that much it all adds up. Every turn you miss a gold you miss a potential extra gold the next turn. Also by knowing what build you plan to force planning for items in the next carousels becomes much easier going forward.  **\"But if everyone goes meta builds youll get unlucky when 4 people are going Cho'Gath and you can't find it?\"** While this is true there is more than 1 meta build. Being able to force a build based on what you get and what other people are going is the balance I believe people should strive for while climbing. Even in a lobby where half the players went Void Sorc I managed to net 4th place or 5th place while putting myself in a better position to get Top 3 or even 1st.  **Conclusion:** Not everyone will agree with my playstyle and probably many top challenger players will play differently, but I have found the most success in forcing meta builds while aggressively making more gold in the early mid game. Doesn't always work out but this has helped me reach top 4 a lot more consistently. After that point first is a matter of details such as items, positioning, etc.   Didn't plan to take this game too seriously but I figured I was decently good enough to give a few tips maybe answer a few questions if anyone has any.", "id": "cn8nzq", "num_comments": 58, "created_utc": 1565198346}, 
{"title": "I got challenger after being \"stuck\" in diamond for a week", "author": "skydieray", "selftext": "Hi, I'm SkyDieRay (   ) and I've been playing TFT since launch with little to no prior autochess experience. (I played DAC for  ~1 week when I found out about tft coming out). Yesterday I got to challenger after I've been playing in diamond for a week.  I've made a list of tips that I think helped me and that I think can help other players get better at the game. This is also available in video format, link at the bottom.     1. Prioritize the right items  The more I play the more I realize it's important to have the right items. Example of very good early game items: Static shiv, ionic spark, GA. These are items that are very good early game and they also hold up in the late-game. Items you should prioritize at early carousel(s): bow- sword/vest- rod- cloak- tear- belt- spatula. Later on, it kinda depends on the items you're missing/looking to make.      2. Don't force team comps before lvl 6/7  Putting the strongest combination of  s will usually beat synergies early/early-mid game so that what you should be focusing on. You don't need the perfect synergies in your team early in the game. Openings that I generally like to go for are 2knights + 2rangers, 2 knights + 3nobles and sometimes 3void + 2brawler if I end up finding those  s. But pretty much anything 2 * * that you can get will be good at helping you win. Also, you don't need to stick with these  s.      3. Be flexibile with your comp.  You can't rely on finding the perfect  s if you   to finish top 4 consistently. You need to be able to play around what the game gives you and that is just something that requires practice and understanding of the game. One example for this is the ranger team comp. For me, I never go into it unless the game gives me the right  s and the right items. And the reason for that is because it's a very contested comp and you'll just fall behind if you keep rolling to get your  s (ashe/kindred/leona). But if the game gives me the  s and I have some decent items (at least a statik shiv), sure I'll go for it and play around it and get an easy top 4 placement.      4. Positioning matters.  Yes, I feel like mentioning positioning even though it's a very basic thing. I've seen people not pay attention to their blitzcranks/zephyrs late-game even in diamond so that's why I feel like this is needed.  It's especially important for assassins, blitzcrank and zephyr, and the late-game. But even in the early game, proper positioning can make the difference between a lost round and a won round. There are full guides that focus on positioning that you can check out for this. The order of importance when it comes to what to watch out for I think is  blitzcrank -  zephyr -  assassins -  anything else. Try to avoid using box-formation if you're against stuff like Chogath, Sejuani, other champs with aoe.      5. Know when you can eco.  The idea is to eco as long as you can keep winning/not losing too much health. Ecoing always gives you the best chance to win the late-game, if done properly. If you can eco and lvl up to 6-7-8-9 very early, not only do you have the advantage of a stronger comp because of more  s and synergies, but you also have a higher chance at finding the carries first (like karthus, draven, tf 3 * * *, etc)      6. Scouting  Scouting allows you to understand how to position around your enemies but also what comps are too contested to be worth going into. It also matters a lot more later in the game, when there are fewer players. Get better at scouting, practice scouting and try to do it between every round, but don't do it if you have to choose between scouting and lvling/rolling/switching your comp.       I hope this helps people and If I got anything wrong, please let me know. If you have any questions, you can leave them below and I'll answer them when I can.

{"title": "[In-Depth Guide] ECON your way to VICTORY with Sorc-Dragon-Guardians.", "author": "Bretsenking", "selftext": "Hello and welcome to my first ever guide (and post) in r/CompetetiveTFT. I have read a lot of other guides and have looked at their feedback to inspire and improve my very own.  **Introduction:**   So I am not Challenger like many of you, but I have climbed from Gold to almost Diamond now the last day, using nothing but this Comp, and it is really strong as it takes use of OP  s like Braum/Shyv/Karth. This is an in-depth guide, but also my first guide ever, so feel free to comment any feedback or questions. I hope some of you are willing to test this out after a read :)  **Items (Sorted by most to least  ed):**   ***Tear:*** This will help out our sorcs a lot! Try rushing a *Spear* or *Seraphs* for Lucian. Will later be moved to Lulu and Veigar.   ***Vest:*** Most important to buff our frontline. Give the Vests to Garen or Darius and upgrade then to *Thornmail* or *GA/PD*. Will later be moved to raid boss Shyv.   ***BF:*** Spear to lulu. Also GA for Shyv, but not the main priority.   ***Rod:*** For Morello for Veigar. Also can be used to make *Ludens/Rabadons* in the late game. Getting an early *Ludens* on Lucian is also possible.   ***Belt:*** Also give this to the early game frontline. Perfect for *Warmog* to Shyv or *Morello* for Veigar(Will later be moved to Karthus/Asol).   ***Spatula:*** Don't really need this in this comp. If you get it, make *FoN*.   ***Bow:*** Bow is highly  ed right now in this meta, which means higher chance to get all the other good stuff. If you get this item from minions, Use it to make *PD* for Shyv.   ***Cloak:*** Try to stay away from this item as it is not very needed in this comp. If you get it, put it on your Braum/Leona and build them *Dragons Claw* if you get another one.    ------  **First Carousel:**   The two main items we will be using in this comp, is Tear and Vest, so look for these in the first carousel, preferably on a tier 2   so you gain that extra coin when you sell it. Even better if you find one of these two items on a Lucian/Fiora/Garen.    ------  [ ^ EARLY GAME:  ^]      Your early game is not supposed to even resemble our late game comp. You need a solid comp for mid game to keep you from losing too much hp while focusing on econ.   By getting an early Noble trait, you will have an upper hand. Try combining this with another knight to have early Knight/Noble traits. If you're not getting all the 3 Nobles/ 2 Knights you  , use Shen/Braum/Kassadin as replacements until you get them (do not sell Braum). Try leveling early to lvl 4.   ------  [ ^ MID GAME  ^]   In mid game you   to establish Knights/Yordles/Sorc traits. This is where you sell your Lucian and put his Spear on Lulu, and Seraphs/Ludens to Veigar. Spear will make Lulu ult every 3-4 auto attacks so it is really a game changer. As i feel like both Ahri and TF are lackluster, they are ok replacements until you find your Veigar and Asol. Since Poppy is a Yordle/Knight, she will be a good placeholder in the midgame for her traits. You should switch her in with your lowest level Knight.   In the mid game, you kinda have to play with what you get, and don't waste your gold on rerolling. if you get an early Ashe, use her with Braum for that Glacial trait. Also remember to level up when you're at 6/18 at level 5 to level 6, so you can econ while picking up your key  s. Also throwing 12 or 16 gold for leveling up to level 7 can also be a smart move.   ------  [ ^ Late Game:  ^]   In the late game you should be at 50+ gold after many rounds of focusing econ. This is when you  t building your empire. Each round, reroll down to minimum 53 gold while picking up your key  s. Your Knights should now have been swapped out with Guardians (Braum/Leona) + Shyvana. Your Sorcs should now be Lulu, Asol and Veigar, and the hunt for Karthus har begun.   Keep your Ashe on the field until you get both Karthus and Kindred, then you can swap her out with Kindred. You can put Ashe back on the field at level 8, as you get the Glacial and Ranger trait from her.   Remember to be aware of other players comps in the late game, as some will use Zephyr or Blitzcrank, and make sure they dont get your Karth. A 9th   can be whatever 5-Cost   you prefer.  *And that's it, you've won. (Or probably placed top 4)*   ------  **Q   A:**   **Q:** If all my power comes from Karth, won't i be countered by assassins?   **A:** With 4 ranged characters in the corner, they will not move in the beginning of a fight. Your Karthus will be safe from assassins (but maybe not Blitz so be aware, and move Karthus around at your own risk)  **Q:** I'm not getting any items combinations to make the item i need for this comp early game, what do i do?   **A:** There is no problem in not making finished items early game, just make sure u have them all out on different champs. the +20 stats can make a big difference, and you'll get your full items soon enough. It's worth the wait.  **Q:** Shouldn't i put my Morello on Asol, since he does AoE as opposed to Veigar?   **A:** If you get an early Morello and an early Asol, this is a better option, yes. I personally prefer Morello on Karthus, but of course, its not every game you get him by level 7 or 8.  **Q:** Can this comp be forced?   **A:** Yes I believe it can to an extent, as I have yet to have a bad game by forcing this comp.", "id": "cm8k2k", "num_comments": 105, "created_utc": 1564995527},

{"title": "One trick to help the lower tiers climb to platinum that you can verify to yourself you are doing", "author": "Virv", "selftext": "Just recently climbed up to platinum.  Had my first 20 games have a 5% win rate in bronze (As in first place) after doing my next 45 games I climbed that win rate up to 17% (That's lifetime, on it's own its somewhere around 24% in the last 45 games).  I took a break in between the first 20 games and  ted studying.    I did a few things, I watched lots of streams, focused on a few builds, and more...  But the one below is BY FAR the easiest to do, and it will result in a small bump in your win rate.  You can also EMPIRICALLY prove you are doing this, there is no judgement call on this if you follow the rules below.    **When you  t the game, the first four to six rounds, SPEND ALL OF YOUR MONEY on heroes to maximize your chances to get any and all heroes up to 2 *. Do not stop spending**   It's like this:    Coming out of the first few creep waves, you   to maximize your chances for 2 * heroes.  A smorgasbord of 2 * heroes is almost always better than synergies between your heroes in the first few rounds. ( I give two exceptions to this below, but try applying this first before you apply the exceptions)  Additionally, you can get all of your money back on 1 cost heroes, even if you combine them.   Some tactics on this:  **Regardless of which item you get from the carousel if you have a 2 cost hero, make a policy of selling that hero to maximize your choices on the bottom bar.**  Why?  Because you will likely not level up a Tier 2   to 2 * before you get to PVP rounds, in fact you 99.9% won't, but the extra shots at 1 cost heroes gives you more opport ies to level THEM up.  2 * T1 heroes are greater than 1 * T2 heroes in all cases.    **Every round, spend all of your gold buying heroes -  do not sell off and do not save until you fill your bar.**  Maximize the amount of possibilities available to you.    **There are no bad 1 cost heroes at this point.** **Don't make value judgements on your heroes until you fill your slots.** I think Elise is straight up hot garbage, she was terrible in the demon meta, and she's now even worse since there are no demon builds.  She's garbage, but I will always take a 2 * Elise and welcome her to my squad.    **Pay Attention:  Put items on your heroes you expect to throw away.**  Right now I am running Yordle Sorc Elemental or Void Brawler Assassin both of those use things like morello's or static shiv, whatever top tier item I finish, I put it on a character I know I won't keep but is great early game.  Your early streak will skyrocket, and thus your win rate, because you'll have more gold early AND have more room to make mistakes.  More importantly, you aren't keeping those items on those heroes anyway, it's not like putting the wrong item on kennen or Cho and then you're fucked.  My favorite place for a turn 4 Morello's is Garen,  my favorite place for a Static Shiv is Nid.  Neither of these characters will be in my end game build under any circumstances.    **Once you fill your slots,  t trimming down.** Do not do it before then, once you have filled your slots, you can  t making qualitative choices about which heroes you keep.  **Prioritize 1 cost heroes over 2 cost heroes unless they are a part of one of your builds.**  Tier 2  s have diminishing returns on  s that are assembled - additionally you are more likely to complete 1 cost  s than 2 cost  s, so I'd de-emphasize them   If multiples of a hero are available (EG 2 graves) always pick them up even if you can't get the 1 instance of the hero that is going to go into your build (EG that one 1 Vayne for your ranger comp you love)  Having a 2 * graves in turn 4 is way better than having that Vayne a few turns earlier for your build.    **Even if you are doing the same build every round this is worth doing.**  Numerically speaking, it is far better to streak hard and open with a ton of 2 * heroes rolling your opponents than it is to get one or two turns of extra reserve gold.    **You can still pivot to your build (or not)** If you are hellbent on a certain build, you can still transition into it, but this will set you up with some early streaks, full health, and a little extra gold to make your build with.   **This is how the best players play.** If you can handle 2 or 3 unique builds, this is THE way to play, because it maximizes working with what the RNG gives you to get a head t into one build.  If you keep 3 builds in your head (Say, Yordle Sorc Ele/Ranger Glacial Guardian/Void Brawler Assassin) then you can make a decision based on what gets handed to you.    There are some nuanced exceptions to these rules but if you aren't doing this - then you should try doing it for awhile, and then learn the exceptions.  (For me, if I get SOME 2 cost  s with certain items on them off of the carousel, for example, I won't sell them, but it's literally 3 possible permutations out of thousands I can think of.)    Anyhow, this is inspired by the fact that I keep watching my opponent's early builds at platinum to see if there will be conflicts with me... and I keep seeing people not doing this.  Roughly 1/3rd of the population at gold/plat doesn't do this and it's way higher at lower tiers.      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  I mentioned an exception above regarding 2 * heroes always being better.    If you have 3 nobles or two wilds and one of them is 2 * you need to make a hard decision on whether or not you drop the synergy to err on the side of more 2 *  s on the field.  All other origins/professions I will ignore and favor 2 * early for the first 5-6 rounds.", "id": "cm56dz", "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1564972508},

I played 3 games at the bronze level (on a new account) and got first place all three times. Then, once I switched over to my main (plat3) I was able to get 1st 2 times and 2nd place 2 times as well. Small sample size, but it never felt contested so that was a good sign for me.  Noble6/Guardian2/Glacial2/Ranger2  Vayne and Ashe make the Ranger synergy, while Ashe and Braum make the Glacial Synergy, while Braum and Leona fufill the Guardian synergy. The rest of the team are the missing nobles (Lucian, Kayle, Fiora and Garen.)      Early game: You are always looking for at least three nobles before you leave minion stages. First round of pvp stages I automatically level and get 4  s on board with the noble buff unless the options are just too enticing not to buy. Even three nobles is still strong, ive defintely leveled up after the first pvp round before with success.  In the event that you dont hit your nobles right away, look for knights/kassadin/pyke/zed. Essentially you are looking to stabalize yourself in order to fish for nobles. You can take the gunlsinger approach to it and reroll down to 0 until you find them, but I usually didnt.       Mid game: Lucian is a big factor in the mid game. Stacking him with damage items and protecting him with knights/brawlers frontline is very important. The entire mid game is focused around econ and leveling to be able to find leona and kayle as fast as possible!  s you need to watch out for during the mid game are Braum/Leona/Kayle/All Nobles.      Late game: Now comes the fun part. Once you have assembled the team, its important to place your guardians in such a way that they double buff your carry (lucian or kayle) in the back of the comp and also double buff your main tank in the front of the group. Backline should be Lucian, Kayle, Ashe and Vayne with everyone else positioned how you like in front of them.      Items: Main items I look for in this comp are Ludens Echo, Hush, RFC (Lucian), RFC, Shojin, Guinsoo (Kayle), Shiv, Shojin (Ashe), Claw, PD, Thornmail (Garen)      If you have any questions or even suggestions let me know.

I prefer Mordekaiser because if I manage to level to 9 I put in sejuani for the additional double Knight buff and the glacial buff to voli.     I played this build for few games in Diamond IV but I'm finding high success and, man, I'm so hyped. You don't really rely on item as I said: all are good, from Ap stuff to Attack speed stuff to tanky stuff.    The champions aren't contested that much (in my elo all are building gunslingers, rangers, guardians, knights, assassin, glacial).     For the early stages of the game I try to run 3 nobles with 1 knight (usually Mordekaiser so I have him for later on) constantly stacking my brawlers and void. The key is Kassadin: he's void and sorcerers, so it grants the void buff (the core is the brawlers) and it opens the road to the sorcerer buff.    This comp is heavily flexible (2 sorcerers you can run what you   until you find karthus maybe and ASol, but really not needed) (warwick/blitz).  Try it and tell me what do you think!          PS: in this screenshot is how it looks like. I picked up kayle instead of sejuani because I was lucky finding 3 of them of course, but normally I'd run a 2   sejuani instead of Kayle (if I hit level 9).", "id": "ck7ove", "num_comments": 25, "created_utc": 1564575230},

{"title": "How to Pivot to a Draven Comp", "author": "meditateguy", "selftext": "After having some fairly decent success with this I thought I'd write up a guide on how to pivot to a draven carry when you're given early dravens. I'm by no means an expert or even good at this game (currently plat 2), so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about anything.   Now at first, I never really played this comp because I'd already have a direction and strategy set up, but after researching a bit about it and trying it the last few days, I've placed almost everytime I've ran it.   From what I've seen, the number one rule when running this comp is that you never  t out trying to run it. You   to just do your normal strategy and then pivot if you're able to hit a level 5 or early level 6 draven.   **Pros**   -Hard counters demons   -Extremely flexible so easy to roll for   -Can completely turn losing games around   -Fun as hell      **Cons**   -Item dependent   -Can't really force it since it's dependent on finding a draven   -Susceptible to blitzcrank and zephyr, need to be aware of positioning      **Items**  1)Rapidfire Cannon (bow+bow)  2)Bloodthirster (cloak+bf sword)  3)Situational (PD for assassins, red buff to counter healing, IE for more damage, shiv for more aoe)  The biggest requirement are actually your items imo. Draven has 2 key items, the first and most important being rapid fire cannon. If you don't have a single bow and aren't first or second round carousel pick it probably would be best to not run draven. The second key item is bloodthirster, and I believe 3rd item      **How to Pivot**  So you just hit level 5 and lo and behold a draven. You check your items and see that you already have at least one bow. How do you incorporate draven in your comp?   The answer is very dependent on the situation. Draven can be fit into most comps, and the main goal of draven's team is to act as meat shields and cc.  For example, say you're running knights. Well if you have darius, he synergizes giving draven an imperial buff and the knights will provide enough tankiness through the early to early-mid game.   If you're going souless' build and already have an aatrox then you should swap out a demon for another blademaster and then add some meat shields (brawlers, knights, guardians). From there look to 2   draven obviously and go for a swain for demon buff w aatrox as well as imperial with draven.  So essentially you   to 1)Get meat shields and cc, and 2)try to synergize with blademaster and/or imperial.  Another tip: If you're running two imperials, you should always save the third on your bench in case you get lucky and hit a swain for the 4 imperial buff.      **Positioning**  How you position draven is fairly important, since he's going to likely be your only source of damage. Make sure to scout and check for blitzcranks and zephyrs. Other than that it's as simple as creating a meat shield wall in front of draven.      **Final Comp**  Your comp is really kind of dependent on what you roll and what your comp looked like before hitting the draven. I think brawlers are a really good choice, as they're very tanky with some cc. If you're playing in this meta, chances are you're going to have an aatrox so it's optimal to throw a shen in for blademasters. I think guardians can be good versus say gunslingers, but not demons.   Always be looking for a swain as he is one of the strongest  s in the game (try to put a morellos on him if you can). He'll not only give you the imperial buff, but also demon synergy if you have aatrox with blademaster.   It may be ideal to take out two brawlers if you  ted with 4 and  ed to add in either guardians if you need it, or swain if you find him.  6 blademasters- This is a trap to go for, as fiora and gangplank are awful  s. I wouldn't run this unless you have a few blade of the ruin kings.       **Other items**  Swain- Morellos or defensive items  Braum- Thornmail or warmogs  Sejuani- Seraphs for quick ults  Aatrox- Gunblade/PD/Dragons Claw          [Here's a screenshot of me winning a hard game using draven. I was dead last until I hit a draven early 6 and pivoted to draven /bm /brawlers.]   **Conclusion**  I thought i'd make this post to encourage anyone who  s to try and run draven to go for it if they get the chance, theres nothing more fun than seeing a 3 item draven decimate a team. This is by no means my main comp, I 've only ran it here or there and am only plat 2, but If you practice it in norms first, then it can really turn lost games around if you happen to get lucky and hit a draven. Say you play 20 games and it happens 1-2 times, if you're able to pull it off, which is pretty easy, that'll increase your win rate and lp a ton in the long run.", "id": "cj7c7b", "num_comments": 49, "created_utc": 1564381130},

I thought for like half that time and came out with a positional plan.      [Position for last round]    Here's the crux of the plan; I shifted my  s to the right so the Assassins have less space to jump my backline(since assassins jump diagonally)      The set-up has 3 properties:     1. The assassins should jump diagonally to my Kennen/Lissandra, which are non-dps  s(non-Demons too) and avoid my Brand, Morg and Varus as much as possible   2. My Akali will jump diagonally near their Pyke and silence/disarm him.    3. I leave a gap for the enemy Pyke to move into so my dps + Akali will fuck him up.

Compostion summary: 1Ele 3Yordle 3Sorc 2Demon 1Ninja   This composition is all about buffing and abusing your elementalists. Kennen in particular is one of the best   in the game and you can abuse all synergies.  With yordle dodge and the proper items on Kennen you can make him an unstoppable team killing machine.  This composition allows for a lot of wiggle room as well, you can sub out all sorcs for ninjas and just go ninja/elementals.  With all of the available options for  s this is probably the most versatile composition.      How it works:  I'm not sure how many people are still unaware but the 3 sorc buff effects all magic damage done by your entire team. We are using sorc buff to give all of our elementalists a free death cap buff. This takes carry Brand, Kennen and Anivia to the next level. With the buffs to morellonomicon and the way elementalists abilities function dealing damage to multiple targets multiple times you can rip through entire teams of tanks like paper.       Core Composition:  Morgana - locket stacked  Kennen - morellonomicon, locket stacked or gunblade   Brand - morellonomicon, any attack speed and ap items ie. rfc, guinsoo, seraphs, shojin  Liss - never put items on Lissandra, EVER  Lulu - no need to stack items however an early shojin will carry you  Veig - shojin and guinsoos or seraphs are best, stack him if you prefer but you should go for tier 3 if you stack      Level 7 and 8  s to consider:  7 Anivia - this   counters a lot of the meta and fits right in liss's slot or in brands slot with spatula items  7 Yasuo - only useful when given early but extremely tanky with high dps  7 Sej / 8 poppy for early 2 glacial and 2 knight buff  7 Draven / Swain - imperial buff on 2 high damage imperials  7 Chogath / 8 Voli - 2 brawler buff and 2 glacial  7 Braum / 8 Leona - 2 glacial and guardian buff      Best tanky items to consider (in order):  Warmogs - strong on most character and we don't use belts much  Dragon Claw - magic resist for eles and sorc builds also insane mana generation on a tank  Phantom Dancer - build for your kennen/brand carry if there is a troublesome assassin player, if not disregard  Thornmail - strong, especially with a gunblade but most armors are used on lockets      Things to consider that are broken in this comp:  Morellos - stops shape-shifting heals, warmogs, any healing!   Subbing out Lissandra late game for Anivia  Making demons with your spatulas, if going swain 1 spat is 4 demon  Making glacials with your spatulas, when going sej 2 spat is 4 glacial  Kennen is extremely good and popular at the moment roll him early buy him asap save him at the cost of economy      Item combinations to look for:  Sword - Zekes, Shojin, Gunblade  Bow - Guinsoos, Rapid Fire Cannon, Phantom Dancer  Rod - Lockets, Morellos, Guinsoos  Tear - Shojin, Seraphs, Demon  Armor - Locket, Phantom Dancer, Thornmail (PD and Thornmail are situational)  Cloak - Dragon Claw, Hush, an early Bloodthirster, Zephyr shenanigans (our worst item by far)  Belt - Morello, Zekes, Warmogs      Item priority:  Rod   Belt   Armor   Bow   Sword   Tear   Cloak      This composition is not necessarily for getting first over and over but for extremely consistent 1st through 3rd place finishes.", "id": "chfg3k", "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1564 9105},

{"title": "How I went from 5W/23L to winning 9 of my last 15 games and hit Diamond!", "author": "sadfactjjj", "selftext": "Hi all fellow river sprites! This is my first time posting on reddit so please be kind :)      First of all, proof:        **This is mostly a story I   to share, guide at the bottom!**      So the story is that I was hard stuck in Silver I/II for a good two days, went from 5W/6L to 5W/23L right as the initial locket meta  ted.  I found myself never able to win, everyone was seemingly highroll and stomp me throughout the game, I was at best placing second and placed 7th/8th frequently even though I very rarely placed that low before ranked came out.      It was obivious to me that I was doing something wrong, be it tilt or strategy wise.  I already realized that the econ strat I had been going for obviously did not work anymore.  As I would be under 50hp even before I can get to 50 gold.  So to combat that, I jumped on the locket OP train and just went for locket components and it still did not work out (I will provide reasons later).      How it all turned around was that I actually just stopped playing ranked and played two normal games with my only friend who is playing TFT.  Looking back, moving away from ranked and play in normals just let me shrug off my tilt, and gave me more time to think about my mistakes and test strategies.  At that time, the meta was quite clear with locket ninja assasin being the clear no.1 comp with voli comps and gunslingers competing (this was last Friday where meta was not as diversified).  So I decided to learn how to play the no.1 comp, from Dog's stream I learned how the fundamentals of the comp and Akali being OP.  And from my own experience of early game being very important I tested the aggressive leveling strategy and not being greedy with my items in my normal games and it worked great!  Speed leveling to 6 and roll down your gold gave me a very decent chance to find the first Akali in the game and complete my comp, early complete items help me win streak or maintain my health.      And I went back to ranked and I just kept on winning, at first I was only able to win through top meta comps aka abusing ninja assasin, but  ting from Saturday everyone in my lobby would go for the ninjas and a lot would at least speed level to 5, so I realized that it became a lot less effective.  Well, I thought it was time to expand my comp pool!  And as lucky as I was, one of the top posts at the time on /r/CompetitiveTFT was a guide by the first Master player in NA (forgot his name and can't find the post anymore, but I'll add the name if someone can tell me in the comments), about how he was forcing Gunslingers in a lot of his games.  So I watched one of his VODs and adopted this strat, and boy it worked wonderfully in my first couple tries.      And then it did not work so well in some games, I realized that it was always because someone else was also going for it.  Which is similar to how ninja assasins don't work in some games, and it made me realize the importance of scouting.  And then I learned more comps from watching streams and reading post on this subreddit (learned demon comp from a post about Hafu using demon comp inspired by another streamer, sorry cannot find the post anymore).  Knowing how to play more comps allowed me to be flexible with my decisions in game and know when I can go for which comp and their strengths and weaknesses.        And eventually I hit diamond today!      **GUIDE  ts here!!!!!!!**   A quick summary:   - Don't tilt, if you feel you are tilted or playing bad, play a couple normal games to review your decisions and calm down   - Self reflect often, everyone is still learning about this game, accept that you are playing bad and evaluate your decisions   - Learn from the good players! Watch their stream and see how their decisions differ from yours and stay on top of the meta   - Learn to play different comps! This helps a lot as more knowledge would allow you to make better decisions. Also by learning I do not mean just look at the final comp, watch at least one game of the comp piloted by a good player!   - Scouting is very important in the game, especially the higher rank you are.  Because again knowledge about other players would also allow you to make better decisions!      My current comp pool:   - Ninja Assasin Elementalist (4 Ninjas + 2 Elementalists + Pyke/Eve)     The obvious one, but I actually only played it twice in my last 6 or 7 games, and my only LP loss game came from it.  Again, the key is to rush level 6 and try to find early Akalis, but also scout other players if more than 3 players are also grabbing ninjas, don't go for it even if you find the early Akali (which is how I lost LP), instead just plug the Akali in your other comp.    Key Items: PD, Dragon's Claw and Seraph on Akali, Locket on Kennen       - Gunslingers (4 Gunslingers + Pyke + Shen/Yasuo or Sej and Cho if no BotRK)     I would go for gunslingers if I have early on hit items or if through scouting I notice no one else is going gunslingers or if before PvP other players did not roll into many Trists.  Then I would just roll all my money and never level untill I find at least Trist 3.  Prioritize carasoul for bows and one spatula.  Key items: Cursed blade, Red buff, BotRK (you pretty much win if you have these three and Trist3) and other on-hit items for Lucian       - BearComps (Volibear + anything)     I actually very rarely go for this comp haha, but I would if I have early bow and roll into a lot of brawlers.  I think it is one of the easier comps to pilot, I would still rush 6 just to find more bears and Cho.  Key items: RFC on Voli, and at least one tanky item on him, Ionic spark also super strong because of tankiness       - Demons (Always include Aatrox and Morg/Eve/Varus are all good, with Elise+Swain+Brand or Brand+Kennen+Ele)    I play demons if I get early demons and mainly in two ways, Demon Shapeshifters only if I have early high level Elise, or Demon Elementalist.  Early demons are surprisingly strong, and again, speed level to 6 to find your Brands or even luck into a Swain.  Level 3 Aatrox or Morg or Level 2 Swain to win!   Key items: Locket on Aatrox/Morg, red buff early on elise is really strong       - Yordles (6 Yordles + Morg/Gunslinger)     Yordles are actually really strong if though scouting you find no one else is going for it.  Because three   makes a huge difference on Veigar.  Going morg or gunslinger depends on if you have early Trist two mainly.  Level 3 Veigar pretty much is a win.  Again speed 6 for Gnar and higher chances of Tier 3s  Key items: Shojin/Seraph on Veigar, locket and/or defensive items on gnar/poppy/morg and try to make one Ionic Spark      Thanks for taking the time to read my post!

Abusing it i won 6 games out of 8 where i built it as a first place, and at others was on the second place. The strategy is a bit flexible, so, we can build it over different champions.      It is simple, but a bit complicated. First of all we need Varus, with Spatula or Rod. Otherwise we can  t from these items, and eventually collect our core. We will need to build one or two Yumi to get it work. So, aim for these items.     At the first 5 levels we try to figure out what we will build, so, for this build we aim to gather Varus and Aatrox. Some websites put Aatrox to the lower tier, so, i will show you how to play him and literally delete the whole enemy team. Our core items are Spear for Varus (Tear + Sword), and Hextech Gunblade for Aatrox (he will heal 1 % HP per cast of his ability). Also put Yumi to Aatrox or Varus (depends of taste). And gather 4-5 magicians. Another Core is Morgana (demon). She gives a nice support damage to our composition and can be usefull against surrounding enemies (like assassins rush).      From other magicians i hardly recommend you to get Lulu. She's buff is necessary for Aatrox focused build, because he is on the frontline, and to get it work he should give his ability, so a bit of surviveability guaranteed from lulu is what we need.      And as a cherry on a top of the pie - add Elise. So far with two Yumi you will reach composition of 6 sorcerers and 4 demons. If your sorcerers build contains Kassadin, you will have nice frontline (Aatrox, Kassadin and Elise) and overpowered backline (Varus 2 lvl will give out around 12  damage to all the enemies on the line). Aatrox is even stronger - his damage on 2 lvl is around 15  damage in a huge AoE. That will multiplie to zero the whole enemy frontline just in few seconds. Aatrox without mana boost needs 3 hits + a bit of enemy focus to give his cast. Few seconds, and the whole enemy team will dissapear from the map.      Ok, is a good build, but what can counter it?    1. Rotating Garen. He ignores all skill damage, so, he will survive our casts. Garen 3 rank with dragontooth will be a problem.  2. Dragons. Aurelion + Shivana will ignore our skill damage and will survive us. Our answer is Demons - Shivana without mana cannot shapeshift in dragon form, that is why we need Elise and Kassadin. Aurelion without mana is even more useless.     3. Noble compositions. There is 50  50 and a positioning give some impact. Our huge problem is Garen, Liona (8 second stun!!!), Fiora (blocks incoming damage) and Kayle. If your Aatrox will explode enemy team before they stack up mana - you win. If theys  ted thier blocking stances - your team will spend too much time trying to damage them, and finaly will fall down.      4.Shapeshifters also can be a problem, cause your team will need a lot of time to beat down Gnar. So, the key to win there is to give your demons a first place in the fight, let them burn out Gnar's MP.      Other teams, such as Yordles, Sorcerers, Assassins, Ninja and Imperors will just spray around in few seconds.      About items - Give your Aatrox and Varus Sedzin Spear, Yumi and Rabaddon. Give your Kassadin or Elise Dragontooth and Frozen Heart. That will be enough to get first place.", "id": "cfe8ws", "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1563575624},

{"title": "Buying  s Other Than The Ones You   When Rolling Down", "author": "SimonMoonANR", "selftext": " This was a common tactic used in Autochess that has reemerged in TFT. However, I found that most people don't actually understand what the impact of doing this tactic is, so I decided to write up a post explaining the math behind it and how much it actually changes your odds.   To  t off, what is this tactic? Its when looking for a specific  , say, Shyvana while rolling down all your money you buy  s at level 3 you don't   in order to increase the odds of finding the   at that level you do  . This did change your odds in Autochess, and we're pretty sure it does in TFT as well, though we don't actually have access to the source code. The big question here is how much it does change your odds.  The first thing to understand is the basic formula for figuring out what % of the time you will find a   you  :  P(finding  ) = 1 - ((1 - (  Tier % /  [# Kind  s in Tier ]))  ^ 5)  In English this is: Probability of finding a   equals one minus the probability of NOT finding a   in a single slot five times.   An example:  P (finding Draven at level 7) = 1 - ((1 - (0.15 / 9))  ^ 5) = 8.06%  Now to take into account bought  s it gets a little more complicated:  P(finding  ) = 1 - (1 -   Tier %  * ( [# Of Each   in Tier ] -  [# Of Specific   Bought)  / ( [# Of Each   in Tier ]  *  [# Of Kinds of   in Tier ] -  [# Of all  s Bought in Tier ]))  ^ 5)  An example:  P(finding Draven at level 7 with 2 Dravens bought and 15 4's in total bought = 1 - ((1 - 0.15  * (13 - 2) / (9  * 13 - 15))  ^ 5) = 7.83%  Now we have a formula that we can use to calculate how much buying the  s you don't   changes your odds of finding what you do  .  I'll  t with the Draven example:  P (finding Draven at level 7 after buying 1 you don't need) = 1 - ((1 - 0.15  * (13) / (9  * 13 - 1))  ^ 5) = 8.13%  There are two ways to think about this, you gain 0.07% Absolute to hit, or we can divide the change by the first P to get the relative gain, or 0.83% relative gain. The way to think about the relative gain is you gain 0.83% of a roll per roll per   you buy that you don't  .   To further establish the numbers, I'll take the Draven situation where things are missing from the pool already.  P(finding Draven at level 7 with 2 Dravens bought and 16 4's in total bought = 1 - ((1 - 0.15  * (13 - 2) / (9  * 13 - 16))  ^ 5) = 7.91%  This change is pretty much exactly the same as the other example 0.08% absolute change. I've plugged in a bunch of numbers and it affects it more when a lot of  s are bought from the pool, but not drastically so (its gonna cap out around 1.5% absolute under any semi plausible conditions).   I'll add some examples for 2's and 3's as well:  P(Finding 3$ at 6) = 1 - ((1 - 0.30  * (21) / (12  * 21))  ^ 5) = 11.89%  P(Finding 3$ at 6 w/ 1 missing) = 1 - ((1 - 0.30  * (21) / (12  * 21 - 1))  ^ 5) = 11.94%  P(Finding 2$ at 6) = 1 - ((1 - 0.35  * (26) / (12  * 26))  ^ 5) = 13.76%  P(Finding 2$ at 6 w/ 1 missing) = 1 - ((1 - 0.35  * (26) / (12  * 26 - 1))  ^ 5) = 13.80%  Overall you see a slightly smaller absolute movement for 2's and 3's and an even smaller relative movement since the baseline probabilities are higher.   Now that I've broken down the numbers the most important question remains: should you do this? Obviously in a vacuum you should do anything that increases your odds of finding what you  . However, in practice doing the overbuying strategy comes with two real costs:  1. It takes time to click on them 2. Takes up bench space  The bench space usually ends up translating into time when you fill up the bench and are then faced with a decision about what to sell, and you have to take the time to sell the overbought  . Additionally, turns where you are rolling down are usually the turns where your time is the most valuable as you are trying to find what you need and improve as rapidly as possible. For example, if you overbuy looking for Akali and roll 10 times you'll find the Akali now less than if you roll 11 times in the same time. Even though you'll find slightly Akali more often over, the powerspike of finding Akali now is worth far more health than the slight increase in finding Akali in two or three rounds when you've run out of gold.   That being said, I think when you have burned through most of your gold and are looking for exactly 1 Tier 4 to improve, it is worth buying there because in this situation you are not time constrained.   TLDR: It barely changes your odds and costs a lot of time, so you should only overbuy when you do not have any time constraints.", "id": "ccp3qm", "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1563023 0},

{"title": "10 Tips for newish players", "author": "quietek", "selftext": "   So  I've been seeing a lot of people asking for tips for new players lately  on the sub and thought I'd make a bit of a guide with some of the  things that imho determine the difference between low and high level  play. For reference, I tied for rank 121 on the PBE prior to the game's  launch on live, and I can pretty confidently say I'm playing in high mmr  on live at the moment (I've queued with dogdog and liquidhyped by pure  chance, while also seeing a lot of names pop up multiple times in my  games and minute+ queues are definitely not uncommon for me to come  across)  1. You're  not going to win every game, and getting top 3 should be your first  goal. Winning should be your second. The reason I say this is that  getting top 3 is likely going to have a significant impact on your mmr  while hitting 4th isn't going to change much. Additionally, sometimes  there will be players who just have a comp you can't beat and that's  okay. This game is more about consistently mitigating RNG as much as  possible rather than just winning the game. Once you hit top 3 you can   t playing to win, and this is when you really need to focus on  positioning to try to outmaneuver your opponents. I'm not going to go  into positioning right now, because its a very complicated topic, but  you shouldn't be afraid to experiment with it and try to learn what  works and what doesn't. Sometimes even with amazing positioning, there  are going to be team comps that just are going to wreck and you can't  win against. This can feel bad, but it's really the nature of the game.  At higher mmr I can say I definitely don't win as many games as I used  to, but I managed to hit my ranking on the PBE by getting top 3 about  66% of the time, with about a 25% winrate. Consistently getting top 3 is  far more important than winning. 2. Economy  is incredibly important. Level once before Krugs, and then build to 50  gold before you  t rolling unless you're falling so far behind you  could actually otherwise die. If you get two of the same level two 1  costs before hitting the 50 gold mark, reroll before you level but try  to stay at 50 gold. If you must go below that mark don't drop below 30  gold. It's MUCH easier to rebuild your economy from 30 gold than 10 or  20, and it usually gives you enough room to find what you really need.  If it's not the case that you have two level two one costs, focus on  leveling and try to manage your econ to stay at 50. Unless you drop  below 30 hp, chances are you'll live a bit longer and you don't NEED to  sacrifice all your econ. That being said there are situations to  sacrifice a bit of econ in favor of leveling, if you have a   that  adding to your comp would provide a significant power spike via a new  synergy or just adding in a strong   into your comp, but my general  rule of thumb is that 30 gold is usually a safe spot to be at, 20 gold  is safe early in the game, but is a lot riskier when people have already  made it to 50 gold. Avoid going all in unless you drop below 30 hp, and  would literally die otherwise. 3. Prioritize  items on the carousel, not  s. Knowing the items is very useful, and  I would strongly encourage you to have a cheat sheet if you don't know  all the item combinations, because items are generally make or break for  the vast majority of team compositions. There are some that can do okay  without items (specifically ive found rangers glacials, and  elementalists to generally do okay without items) but the majority of  team compositions are extremely item dependent. Sometimes it may be  worth pivoting away from one comp for a different one just because of  the items you get. For example if you're getting a bunch of tears and  building assassins, it may be worthwhile to look at building a comp that  is more ult dependent than assassins are. This is pretty debatable  though and you can generally make most comps work with most items, but  it's important to keep it in mind and pay attention to what items work  well with which comps. So use a cheat sheet or overlay if you don't know  all the item combinations. 4. 4  cost  s are the most important. By a very large margin. This is  because they're still relatively easy to get to level two, and have  incredible effects on power spikes, especially if they work decently  into your synergy. Akali, Draven, A Sol, and Brand all make the best  carries in the game imo, and Cho'gath, Sejuani and Gnar all offer  incredible value for CC. Kindred is also an extremely useful utility   . 4 costs are really the most important  s in the game 90% of the  time, and often are the  s that will carry you to the end of the  game. 5. Stay  flexible during the early game. Don't get tunnel vision for one  specific team comp and don't over commit to a single team comp prior to  getting the necessary 4 or 5 cost  . I.E. never commit wholly to  nobles if you don't have Kayle. There's never a guarantee you'll see  Kayle at all, and nobles really struggle without her. Assassins and  nobles I find to be bait a lot of the time, as kayle is never guarenteed  and Assassins feel pretty item dependent in general, and will really  struggle without them. You also end up forced to keep a lot of value on  the bench with ninjas in assassins a lot of the time before you can  fully commit to the build. That said, I find the best comps for new  players to generally be rangers, glacials, and elementalists. These  builds aren't crazy item dependent and are still quite strong. 6. Completed  items are better than no items. That is to say that if you're getting  close to dying or the game is close to over, even if an item isn't  optimal for your build, it may be worth it to just make it and put it on  somebody. There are very few situations where a completed item isn't  going to have any positive effect on your team comp, even if its small,  its better than nothing so to speak. 7. Don't  be afraid to experiment. This game is really heavily about trial and  error and learning what works and what doesn't. If you're curious if  something might work, try it, and see how it goes. If it doesn't work,  you learn about why it didn't, and learn what might work a bit better  for next time. This game is very knowledge and learning based, so often  losing and figuring out why you lost is more valuable than just building  a meta comp and stomping all the other players. That said there's a lot  to know about this game and like I said, its very much a game of trial  and error where you learn what works and what doesn't. 8. Scout.  At least pay attention to what other people are building when you go up  against them. You all share the same   pool, so it's important to at  least pay some attention to other players comps. Just as an example,  avoid building assassins if there are three other assassin players on  the board, it'll make it much more difficult to hit assassin  s. 9. Try  to mitigate rng, don't avoid it. What I mean by this is don't force a  comp, and stay flexible. It'll work out sometimes if you try and force a  comp and it may even be a comp where you win almost every game when it  does work out, but if it doesn't you get kinda screwed. This kinda plays  into tunnel vision as well, but if there is only one comp that you can  confidently build, youre going to struggle when you can't find the  s  you need or the items you need, and you're going to learn very little  compared to experimenting and trying new things. 10. Have  fun, and remember its just a game. While I haven't seen nearly as much  toxicity in this game compared to league or Overwatch or other team  based games, I still come across people who get salty because one person  went for the meta locket or pyke build at the time, or constantly  complain about how bad their RNG is (btw just a hint, if you feel like  your rng is always bad, chances are your either getting tunnel vision or  youre constantly building into a comp that others are going after, it's  a pretty good sign that something is going wrong.) Really my point here  is that you don't contribute anything with toxicity except making other  players annoyed, and it also tends to play into you not learning and  blaming poor rng or a specific build for doing poorly rather than  focusing on where you can improve. There really isn't anyone to blame  but yourself in this game, even the current locket meta isn't an auto  win, and really you can't blame RNG For every game, when many players  are able to do very well very consistently.  Hopefully  this is helpful to someone out there, I  ed to write this up since I  see a good number of people asking for tips, and while a lot of these  are probably known to more advanced players, and im sure there's some  things that some players may disagree on, but generally for people just  getting  ted with the game or looking to improve from the basics I  think this should help you do a bit better.

It's really easy to build, and you don't have to commit a lot at all. Yet I get it nearly every time.   First I go for either 3 nobles (fiora/lucian, vayne and garen), or I try to get the knight bonus (morde/darius instead instead of fiora/lucian - I prefer morde to have more options midgame with kindred).  At the 4th champion I put in the knight or try to finish nobles. - this allows me to survive early game (you will lose vs assassins and wilds, but that's not a big problem as long as you keep more than 1 health). If I fail to get a noble/knight I immediatelly try the next step:  4th or 5th champion (based on which is lv 2) I  t going for rangers, ideally you can find an early ashe for the cc. Always making sure i get the 5th before the healing jungles. (should be at least 1 time spending xp). Typically if you have 2 rangers, 2 knights, 3 nobles you can easily win fights around this point.   So far I have not ever rerolled. In the midgame I tend to be \"boring\" with only upgrading the champions I have, and aiming for 50 gold asap.   After I get 50 gold I  t rerolling for lvl 2s. The 6th god is the most tricky part of the build: if you have ashe already you ideally hope to pick up sejuani, or braum (even trickier). If you had to go with varus instead of ashe it's getting a bit harder here, but I hope for a kindred (morde + kindred). Or failing that: an ashe.   If I have 6, without sejuani + ashe, I try to make sure to get all rangers (while upgrading lvls) - and once I found those I buy xp for the level as soon as possible.   With 4 rangers the build is nearly \"complete\": again I  t looking for an ice god: sejuani ideally but failing that I look for braum, or even any other ice god (even spatula is good now).  You should now have noble 3, ranger 4, void 2, knight 2: important are the void 2 and ranger 4 bonus. But even the noble bonus quite often helps in close fights.   Final touches are to find leona if you picked braum (switch out fiora), find kayle to switch out garen, and find draven if you had darius.

I found the wild/sorc/demon comp is a solid flexible early, solid mid and decimating late game comp that's been pretty consistent.  Ideally, you  t in the basic carousel for ahri, lulu, nidalee, ww or if you can't get any of those then armor, needlessly large rod, tear or bf sword. Early levels you   to econ and go for early nids, ww and kassadin even if you can't get them 3 early. Ideally you have at least 2 at rank 2. Try to complete the early game, but don't get discouraged if you just have all 3 at 2. Then you wait for krogs and still wait, you don't do hyper re-roll strat because that would yield primarily one  s and the core of the comp relies on 2 and 3  s. You wait when you are 4 exp away from level 5 and then you break the bank and look for veigar, almost never level higher than 2, morg, ideally level 3, lulu, ideally level 3, and ahri, which is fine at 2. You broke the bank and then keep econ for brand and other  s right before the next level up or if you're close to dying. Once you have brand and or aurelion you are set, but if you are ahead enough karthus can always push you through.  * * *You can have tristana and/or kenen on the side for the yordle buff if you are having issues finishing up the sorc comp and blitz is always a good strategy for corner and for buffing up warwick.  After you have your comp, ideally you   morgana with as many lockets as possible. Lulu with as many shojins as possible. FoN is huge in this comp so I generally try to lose the few early games and try to set up for the possible second spatula at some point. You ideally have a rank 3 warwick or kassadin for which you would have a dragon's claw to counter other sorcs and a thornmail to counter the rest. Additionally you can give phatom dancer to the frontline as well.  * * *Items are always a mixed bag so do what you can, but the comp has enough variety in items that you have enough flexibility to generally find things.  Front line:  Kassadin  Warwick  Morgana  Back line:  Lulu  Ahri  Nidalee  Veigar  Brand (Take out nid at this point)  Karthus (After you get 8 slots)   * * *Blitz for earlly mid game on side corner and lvl 2 to 3 tristana for yordle buff if needed  Shojin: tear of the goddess + bf sword  Locket of the Iron Solary: armor + needlessly large rod  Phantom Dancer: armor + recurve bow", "id": "ca6hjq", "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1562503829},

I have come with another new strategy this time it is GUNSLINGER,YORDLE INTO ELEMENTALIST,SORCERER,    GLACIAL,NINJA,KNIGHT. In this strategy you have damage peel and stun and hp which I will describe in guide.    **Guide**:   Firstly from shared draft  t a champion with **recurves bow or rod or chain west** then Try to **get gunslingers** like graves and tristana on early game.After getting those champ **look for knight** or any other combination to survive your early game. After that go for **yordle** because yordle's passive where your  s dodge attacks.Now from Here, you can either go for gunslinger such as gp and lucian,mf or you can go **Elementalist** which I have done in this video which gives you a **Daisy** and you just needed to stack up into your adc. **I would say this game is not a script there are so many combination that you mix it up and make it work out.** Because an item called **SPATULA** can change lots of things.  This game I went for early Gunslinger to stack up my tristana with rageblade first then had knight to survive early game.I look up for yordles which i got during mid game poppy,lulu and tristana. Afterwards I decided to go 3 yordles with 2 gunslinger with 3 elementalist and lastly I went glacial because Sejuani is a really good champ for late game and with lissandra it will give me the passive. I did use spatula on sol so i can get Knight's passive    **Champs**: Tristana, Kennen, Lulu (**Yordles** Passive:20% Chance to Miss)                   Brand, Kennen, Lissandra (**Elementalist** Passive: Summon Daisy)                     Karthus, Sol, Lulu **(Sorcerer** Passive: +35% spell damage.)

Guide-  **CHAMPS:**    Vayne + Garen + Fiora + Lucian + Leona + Kayle **(Nobles)**  Braum **(Guardian)**  Sejuani **(Glacial)** or Ashe **(Glacial + Ranger)**  Strategy: ** t off with whichever 3 Nobles** you can find, preferably **Vayne + Garen + Fiora**. Your **carry is Vayne** this game so feel free to stack her with items. **Add Ashe** (or a temporary ranger until you find Ashe) for the Ranger bonus, **then Braum for 2 Glacials,** and then **Leona for Guardians**. Once you find **Kayle**, cut Ashe and Braum for **Lucian** and Kayle. Re-add Braum when you have room (probably immediately), and then either Ashe or Sejuani.  Must read: This build is incredibly reliant on finding a Kayle and thus  ts to fall off really hard in the mid-game. Winning the early game and being greedy for levels is necessary, and the build can still completely wiff if you just don't get a Kayle, so don't expect it to be reliable.**Other way** is going for 4 Glacial like I did in this video so it is always situational.**You have to find good synergy with other passive and build your best team.** Second Episode of my series all I need is your support and I will upload more videos with new strategy.
