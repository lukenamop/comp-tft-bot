This is the source code for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CompetitiveTFTBot">u/CompetitiveTFTBot</a>, a Reddit bot built for the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT">r/CompetitiveTFT</a> subreddit.

# TFT Ranked Flair Verification

The bot has a verification flow to allow redditors on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT">r/CompetitiveTFT</a> subreddit to verify their TFT accounts and automatically receive ranked user flair. Previously, ranked flair verification was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/ftuyau/masters_ranked_flair_request_thread/">done by hand here</a>, this bot takes care of the process for the moderator team so they can focus on other aspects of running the subreddit.

## Can this be used on other subreddits?

The code, as it is was written, is specifically for use on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT">r/CompetitiveTFT</a> and would need a handful of changes to be compatible with other subreddits. If you run a subreddit that would benefit from this bot, please reach out to me on Discord at lukenamop#0918 and I would be happy to help you get it set up.
